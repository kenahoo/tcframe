Design Doc for TCFRame;
TCFRame is an application framework for classification (mostly docs)


package TCFrame
# The class should provide methods that describe a complete
# experiment: collection, method, parameters used in the training...

Methods:
	clean;
	backup;
	describe;


package TCFrame::Classifier
# Type of learning classifier
# All classifiers should be subclasses of AI::Categorize, and conform
# to its interface.


package TCFrame::Classifier::NNet
# Neural Nets, at this it just a wraper to previous work.  Needs to be
# adapted to AI::Categorize model

Attributes:
	MOMENTUM = 0.5;
	EPOCHS =	5;
	N = 		500;
	HIDDEN=	50; (Number of hidden units)
	SAVE = 	0;
	COR = 		"signalg";
	WT= 		"ntc";
	K=		50;
	THRES= 	500;
	CV = 		200;
	CVEXP = 	3;
	EXP 	=	$COR;
	ALPHA 	= 	0.9;

methods:
create_vec;
create_trn_nnt;
sub create_tst_nnt;
create_net;
train;
test;

package TCFrame::Classifier::NaiveBayes
# Naive Bayes
Attributes:
	features_kept => 0.2 (what portion of the features should be kept during feature selection)
	threshold => 0.3 (score threshold for category membership during categorization)

Methods:
	


package TCFrame::Collection
#The class provides collection wide utilities and data structures.
# A collection can also be called a "corpus".

Atributes:
	Description;
	DTD;
	Language;

Methods:
	parse(from,to);    # e.g. smart2xml, reuters2smart,...
	tfidf(tfidf-args); # use smart package, then replace
	feasel (fselargs); # feature selection method

package TCFrame::Collection::Document
# Document class

Methods:
	stopwords;
	stemming;
	


package TCFrame::Collection::Map
# Manages a mapping between categories & documents.  Can look up
# either by category or by document, so we use a double hash.
