\chapter{\aicat\ Framework Design}

The \aicat\ framework is designed for maximum re-use in many
kinds of situations \ldots XXX.

For brevity, the \aicat\texttt{::} prefix will be omitted from class
names in this discussion.  It is to be understood that any class
within the \aicat\ framework (except the top-level class
\aicat\ itself) is prefixed by \aicat\texttt{::}.

\section{Overview of \aicat\ class hierarchy}

In order to understand the structure of the \aicat\ framework,
multiple kinds of analysis are helpful.  We can examine the
inheritance relationships of the classes that participate in
\aicat\, and indicate which classes inherit from each other.
Since a class generally is a representation of certain
responsibilities and capabilities, this lets us see how the set of
responsibilities for one class may be implemented in different ways or
extended by its subclasses.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/inheritance-uml.pdf}
\caption{Inheritance diagram for \aicat}
\label{inheritance-uml}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{inheritance-uml} shows the inheritance relationships among
classes in the \aicat\ framework.  Note that this diagram
indicates the \emph{capabilities} of the framework more than it
indicates its \emph{architecture}.  For instance, the framework
currently understands several document types, including plain text
documents and documents in the ``SMART'' format.  If the framework is
extended by writing additional subclasses of existing classes, the
capabilities increase without changing the basic architecture of the
framework.

Note that the inheritance diagram is not particularly enlightening
about how various classes cooperate to perform text categorization
tasks.  The inheritance relationships are set at compile-time and do
not change while the framework is in use.\footnote{Perl allows the
dynamic reassignment of inheritance, but this capability isn't used
in the framework.}

Another way to examine the framework is to examine the run-time
relationships between its classes.  This often provides a much more
enlightening analysis of a framework, since modern framework design
often favors object composition over class inheritance for its
important structural elements. \cite[p. 20]{gamma:95}

The diagram in figure \ref{classes-uml} shows the
most important run-time relationships between classes in the
\aicat\ framework.  In this diagram, no inheritance
relationships are shown--any inheritance hierarchies are represented
only by their parent classes.  In general, a class and its subclass
will share an interface and have identical relationships to other
classes, but will differ in implementation.  Therefore, the
relationships indicated in this diagram indicate stable aspects of the
framework that do not change when the framework is extended by
subclassing.

\end{figure}

Some examination of the basic relationships between classes and the
responsibilities of each class is helpful before looking at the design
in more detail.  The major classes in the \aicat\ framework
are:

\begin{description}

\item[KnowledgeSet]

The \class{KnowledgeSet} class represents a set of processed documents, a set
of categories, and a many-to-many mapping between the two sets.
Processing may involve tokenization, stopword removal, linguistic
stemming, feature selection, and vector weighting.  Note that the term
``knowledge set'' is somewhat unique to this project.

A \class{KnowledgeSet} contains references to many \class{Document} objects and
\class{Category} objects.  It uses \class{Collection} objects to instantiate \class{Document}
and \class{Category} objects.  It uses a \class{FeatureSelector} object to perform
feature selection.  It also contains a \class{FeatureVector} object
representing the features present in all documents.

\item[FeatureSelector]

Feature selection is performed by subclasses of the \class{FeatureSelector}
class.  Each \class{KnowledgeSet} object contains a \class{FeatureSelector}
object--the \class{KnowledgeSet} provides the information necessary to do
feature selection, and the \class{FeatureSelector} performs the desired
feature selection algorithm.

\item[Collection]

Because data sets in text categorization may be very large, and
because their documents may exist in several different underlying
storage mechanisms (e.g. as files in a filesystem, sections of a
larger XML file, or fields in a database), a \class{Collection} class provides
an abstract interface to a set of stored documents, together with a
way to iterate through the set and return \class{Document} objects.

A \class{Collection} object may be used in several contexts within the
framework.  For instance, a \class{KnowledgeSet} instantiates its Document and
\class{Category} objects through a \class{Collection} object.  A \class{Learner} object may
also mass-categorize the \class{Documents} in a \class{Collection} object.

\item[Document]

Each text document is represented by a \class{Document} object, or an object
of one of its subclasses.  Each document class contains methods for
turning a bunch of data into a \class{FeatureVector}.  Each document also has
a method to report which categories it belongs to.

\item[Category]

Each category is represented by a \class{Category} object.  Its main purpose
is to keep track of which documents belong to it, though it also
contains methods for examining statistical properties of an entire
category.

\item[Learner]

The abstract \class{Learner} class provides an interface to train on a
set of pre-categorized documents and subsequently categorize
previously unseen \class{Document} objects.  Its
concrete subclasses implement specific categorization algorithms like
Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and so on.

\item[FeatureVector]

Most categorization algorithms don't deal directly with documents'
data, they instead deal with a \emph{vector representation} of a
document's features.  Most often, documents are represented using the
``Bag of Words'' model \cite{XXX}, i.e. a non-ordered, weighted set of
features.  The \class{FeatureVector} class provides an interface to the
operations one may perform on these vector representations, such as
querying features' presence or absence in a document, adding vectors
to each other, and so on.

\item[Hypothesis]

The result of asking a \class{Learner} to categorize a previously unseen
document is a \class{Hypothesis} object.  It may be queried for information
about which categories were assigned, which category was the single
most appropriate category, what scores were assigned to each category,
and so on.

\item[Experiment]

The \class{Experiment} class can examine the results of many categorization
decisions (i.e., many \class{Hypothesis} objects) and may be queried for
aggregate information about the results.  This is often used in order
to determine the quality (as measured by precision, recall, error,
etc.) of a \class{Learner} on a collection of test documents.

\item[AI::Categorizer]

XXX need to write about the umbrella class

\section{Design Patterns in \aicat}

In order to shed light on the design of the \aicat\ framework,
XXX \ldots.


\subsection{Iterator}

The Iterator pattern provides ``a way to access the elements of an
aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying
representation.'' \cite[p. 257]{gamma:95} Its main purpose is to
decouple the traversal process on an object's aggregate members from
the object's internal data structure implementation.  In this way,
clients can iterate through aggregate objects without knowing the
objects' internal structure.

In the \aicat\ framework, it is often necessary to iterate
through collections of documents and perform some action on them.  For
example, the documents may form a training set for a \class{Learner} to base a
model on, or they may form a test set on which to evaluate the model.

The \class{Collection} class implements the Iterator pattern
\cite[p. 257]{gamma:95} over documents in the framework.  Figure
\ref{Iterator-collection} shows the main relationships involved in
this pattern.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/Iterator.pdf}
\caption{The Iterator pattern in the \class{Collection} class}
\label{Iterator-collection}
\end{figure}


\cite[p. 259]{gamma:95} suggests that the most common reasons for
using a formal custom iterator are:

\begin{itemize}

\item to access an aggregate object's contents without exposing its
internal representation.

\item to support multiple traversals of aggregate objects.

\item to provide a uniform interface for traversing different
aggregate structures.

\end{itemize}

The first and third reasons are most germane to the document iteration
process.  As explained in section \ref{Document storage}, it is
important that the framework can directly import documents from their
various underlying storage mechanisms in order to prevent unnecessary
duplication of data.  In order to hide the details of the storage
mechanism from the rest of the framework, a \class{Collection} object
retrieves documents from several storage mechanisms and returns them
as \class{Document} objects.  It provides a unified interface to iteration
over stored documents so that the various classes that need to perform
this iteration (chiefly \class{Learner} and \class{KnowledgeSet}) don't need to be
aware of storage issues.  In this sense, the ``internal
representation'' of the aggregate structure is often external to the
framework itself--it may be files in a filesystem, entries in a
database, records in an XML document, or another mechanism.

In addition to providing a generic interface to a stored collection of
documents, the Iterator pattern allows clients of the \class{Collection} class
to use memory efficiently.  A \class{Collection} object will typically defer
creation of its \class{Document} objects until its client calls its
\method{next} method.  In this way, the \class{Collection} doesn't store all
the \class{Document} objects in memory simultanously--if the client needs to do so,
it can, or it can merely query properties of each document and dispose
of them in turn.

Note that the \class{Collection} class defines a \method{next} method,
but no \method{previous} method.  This is largely because common
document storage mechanisms like filesystems or databases typically
only have one-directional iterators.  Insisting that
\class{Collection} classes needed to implement a \method{previous}
method to support bi-directional iteration would impose an
unreasonable burden on them.

In order to decouple the storage mechanism from the internal format of
documents (see section \ref{Document format}), \class{Collection}
classes can cooperate with any subclass of the \class{Document} class.
The client of the \class{Collection} class informs it that it should
instantiate documents using a certain \class{Document} subclass.
Since the \class{Document} subclasses share a common interface, \class{Collection}
may remain ignorant of all internal document formatting issues,
passing data to the proper constructors in order to instantiate
\class{Document} objects.


\subsection{Composite}

The Composite pattern ``lets clients treat individual objects and
compositions of objects uniformly.'' \cite[p. 163]{gamma:95} It is
often used to represent trees or other data structures in which the
form of a subset of the structure is not qualitiatively different from
the form of the entire structure.  In simple terms, this means that
the same kinds of operations--iteration over subnodes, inspection of
the root node, and so on--can be performed on the entire tree, a
subtree, or even a single node.

In fact, the Composite pattern does not apply only to tree
structures.  It applies whenever a self-similarity exists between the
whole and the parts in a part-whole hierarchy.

One instance of this kind of structure in Text Categorization is in
so-called ``ensemble learners,'' also known as ``classifier
committees.''  An ensemble learner is a categorizer that combines the
results of a set of other categorizers in some way to arrive at a
categorization result of its own. \cite[p. 30]{sebastiani:02} Often,
an ensemble learner may outperform each of its constituent members on
the general categorization task.  \cite{tumer:98}

To implement ensemble learners within \aicat\, the Composite
pattern may be applied to the \class{Learner} class to create a
\class{Learner::Ensemble} subclass.  Figure \ref{Composite-ensemble}
shows the classes participating in this pattern.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/Composite.pdf}
\caption{The Composite pattern in the \class{Learner::Ensemble} class}
\label{Composite-ensemble}
\end{figure}

Since \class{Learner::Ensemble} is a subclass of the abstract
\class{Learner} class, it conforms to the \class{Learner} interface.
This is crucial to implementation of the Composite pattern--it means
that clients may use the \class{Learner::Ensemble} class without
knowing that it implements an ensemble learner behind the scenes.  In
this way, transparent ensemble learning is achieved through
polymorphism.

According to \cite[XXX]{sebastiani:02}, ensemble learning techniques
can be specified by (1) a set of individual learners (the ``members''
in Figure \ref{Composite-ensemble}), and (2) a mechanism for combining
the output of the individual learners.  The \class{Learner::Ensemble}
class can provide generic support for creating the member learners of
the ensemble, but the combination mechanism may take many different
forms.  Such algorithms are an active area of Machine Learning
research.  As such, \class{Learner::Ensemble} may be subclassed in
order to implement different combination mechanisms.


\subsection{Adapter}

The Adapter pattern ``XXX.'' \cite[p. XXX]{gamma:95}  It is commonly
used when an existing resource provides the functionality necessary
for a certain task, but the interface of that resource doesn't match
the interface necessary for the environment in which that task must be
performed.  For example, ...
