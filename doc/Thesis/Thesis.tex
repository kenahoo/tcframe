\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank Rafael Calvo for his expert supervision of my
thesis, and for giving me the opportunity to pursue this project.  The
rest of the Web Engineering Group---Jae-Moon Lee, Xiaobo Li, Nick
Carroll, and Gosia Mandrela---provided valuable testing and feedback
on \aicat\ and created a quite pleasant working environment.  The
Language Technology group---particularly Casey Whitelaw, Elisabeth
Crawford, and Jon Patrick---was also a good source of feedback and
inspiration.  The Open-Source community provided incentives to write
clean, usable, documented software by their mere existence.  Research
Assistantship funding from the Capital Markets Co-operative Research
Centre provided much-appreciated support for research on the Signal G
corpus.

On a more personal level, I would like Sheri Schechinger for sticking
with me across ten thousand miles of ocean, and the city of Sydney for
being such a great place to spend some time.
