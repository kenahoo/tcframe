\chapter*{Preface}

This thesis represents research into and implementation of a framework
for automatic Text Categorization (TC).  In order to produce such a
framework, research into current TC algorithms has been necessary, as
well as research into software engineering practices for building
object-oriented frameworks.

The framework, called \aicat, has been designed with the goal of being
generically useful for building real-world TC applications, and for
being extensible using common framework extension techniques.
