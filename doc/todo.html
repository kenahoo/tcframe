<p>In rough order of priority:</p>

<table border=1 bgcolor="#CCFFCC">

 <td>October 1</td>
 <td>10</td>
 <td>4, 13</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>6</td>
 <td>Thesis</td>
 <td>Read/Document classification products in the marketplace. "I am
  thinking of 1 page at most for each, unless you find something
  particularly interesting. This should also be part of your references
  section so it should not only be commercial products but research in
  ML frameworks (like the one in Fayad's book)"</td>
 <td>October 1</td>
 <td>3</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>12</td>
 <td>Thesis</td>
 <td>Implement full spectrum of TF/IDF weighting scheme</td>
 <td>October 15</td>
 <td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>8</td>
 <td>Thesis</td>
 <td>Write set of 1-page use-cases for application developers using
  AI::Categorizer.  Include scenarios for webmail, filesystem, CRM, etc.</td>
 <td>October 10</td>
 <td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>9</td>
 <td>Thesis</td>
 <td>Write more about framework design decisions in thesis.  "This is
  probably a continuos work, that you are mostly doing in the code but I
  think it would be good if it becoms part of a doc, I know you already
  have stuff there! Include the discussion between distributed and 'in
  DB' adavantages/disadv. that we had with Mark."</td>
 <td>October 1</td>
 <td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>10</td>
 <td>Thesis</td>
 <td>Set up public CVS repository, probably on SourceForge.  This is
  only for the AI::Categorizer code, not all my thesis work.  That
  should stay local.</td>
 <td>October 1</td>
 <td>1</td>
