Outline of Ken Williams' thesis work

$Header$

* Goals

** Build a framework for document classification using the state-of-the-art techniques in the literature

** Improve on existing classification methods

** Build a useful application that uses the framework

** The framework should be publically available under open license

** The framework should be useful in a broad range of situations


* Assessment criteria

** Duplication of literature-published performance metrics will demonstrate successful implementation of standard techniques

** Publication of previously unknown results, or previously unseen performance metrics, will demonstrate improvement on published classification methods

** The successful use of the application by anyone will demonstrate its completion

** The framework should be uploaded to CPAN and pass the CPAN-Testers testing procudures

** The successful use of the framework by other people not involved in this project will demonstrate its completion and usefulness


* Planning

** Class Hierarchy

See 'docs/classes.xml' (a UML diagram) in the CVS repository for class
relationships.

** Design Goals

The framework must be able to accommodate functionality in a number of
essential areas, providing common behavior while allowing users and
developers to customize behavior through parameter specification
and/or subclassing.  These essential areas include prior knowledge
data format, document structure, data tokenizing, linguistic stemming,
feature selection, vector space modeling, machine learning algorithm
choice, and hypothesis behavior.

The framework will be designed in such a way that it will be able to
grow, adding functionality as needs are assessed.  This growth should
occur without adversely affecting users who have built applications
based on earlier versions of the framework.  Users should be able to
routinely take advantage of both bug fixes and feature enhancements in
the core framework.

** Critical Path
