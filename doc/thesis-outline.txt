Outline of Ken Williams' thesis work

* Goals

** Build a framework for document classification using the state-of-the-art techniques in the literature

** Improve on existing classification methods

** Build a useful application that uses the framework

** The framework should be publically available under open license

** The framework should be useful in a broad range of situations

* Assessment criteria

** The successful use of the framework by other people not involved in this project will demonstrate its usefulness

** The successful use of the application by anyone will demonstrate its usefulness

** Publication of previously unknown results, or previously unseen performance metrics, will demonstrate improvement on published classification methods

** Duplication of literature-published performance metrics will demonstrate successful implementation of standard techniques
