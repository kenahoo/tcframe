MEDIA RELEASE

ATC TO ACQUIRE AMERICAN TEC IN \$25 MILLION DEAL

ASX listed Australasian Technology Corporation Limited, has signed a
heads of agreement to purchase, pending shareholder approval, the
American Tec Company Limited (ATL), a Hong Kong based distributor of
capital equipment for A\$11.5 million cash and the issue of 9.2
million shares.

American Tec sells its products to the major producers of printed
circuit boards and semiconductors in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China.

ATC
'
s group executive director, Mr Cheng Leong Tan, said today that
since 1983 American Tec operated an almost identical business to ATC
in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong and in a number of cases acted as
distributors for the same manufacturers.


"
Both ATC and ATL share common suppliers and customers but operate in
different sectors of the Asian market, so this acquisition
complements both company
'
s existing operations and will result in
better servicing of our clients throughout Asia,
"
 he said.


"
This acquisition also represents a dynamic merging of activities
into a strong, consolidated enterprise that covers Asia entirely for
our customers such as Acer, Nokia, Intel, Hewlett Packard, Phillips,
Motorola and 18 other international companies.
"


Mr Tan said the agreement and ASX listing rules means the acquisition
will need to be completed by 3-6-00 as ATC was purchasing a company
larger than its existing business and once the ATL acquisition was
completed ATC intended to seek a secondary listing on the Singapore
Stock Exchange.

Mr Tan said ATL
'
s unaudited forecast for the year ended 31-3-00 is
HK\$400.9 million with profit after tax of HK\$21.8 million - roughly
A\$85 million and A\$4.6 million respectively.

ADCORP AUSTRALIA LIMITED
Sydney
Adcorp Australia Limited, the innovative communication services
organisation providing advertising agency and Internet development
services, announced a 9.8% increase in net profit after tax to \$5.274
million for the financial year ended 30th June 2000, exceeding
Prospectus forecast by 4%. This was achieved on a revenue base of
\$115 million, up 15% on the previous corresponding period.

Adcorp Australia has delivered 19 consecutive years of sales growth
and the 1999/2000 financial year has, once again, been one of high
activity with continued profit performance. All business units within
the group in both Australia and New Zealand have experienced strong
organic growth.

Adcorp
'
s Chairman, Ric Charlton, said that the result was a sound
reflection of the Company
'
s growth strategy and the strength of its
management. 
"
Notwithstanding some signs of a slow down in business
activity, we are confident in what lies ahead, given our ability to
anticipate change and our preparedness to implement the consequent
opportunities for the future growth of Adcorp Australia Limited.
"


In May 2000, Adcorp signed an exclusive licence agreement with the
American-based recruitment software developer, Recruiting Solutions
International, Inc. Under the terms of this agreement, Adcorp
obtained an exclusive licence in Australia and New Zealand to market
their web-based, online recruitment management system under the brand
recruitmanager. In addition, a technology exchange has been
established between the two companies and Adcorp has taken a minority
equity position and an option for a further shareholding in
Recruiting Solution International, Inc. This software licence
represents a strategic move in Adcorp
'
s ongoing commitment to
introducing Innovative products to its client base and creates the
potential for a revenue and income stream in addition to that
generated by Adcorp
'
s traditional print media income.

In July 2000, Adcorp Australia acquired Brema Advertising, a
Christchurch, New Zealand-based recruitment advertising agency,
which will provide an immediate contribution to profit; give presence
in the South Island of New Zealand; and most importantly provide a
platform for cross-selling Adcorp
'
s traditional and Internet-based
products and services.

In August 2000, Adcorp also announced that it had acquired Lewis
Advertising Limited, based in Tauranga, New Zealand. Lewis
Advertising is the country
'
s second largest specialist recruitment
advertising agency with an annual turnover of approximately NZ\$10M.
This acquisition moves Adcorp to the number two position in the New
Zealand market, and provides a mechanism for the creation of
operational synergies within New Zealand, together with the product
extension across a wider clientele. It is also an investment that
makes a positive contribution to earnings per share from the outset.

Managing Director, Ian Rodwell, stated that 
"
The Company is well
positioned, both financially and structurally, to capitalise on its
growth strategy of leveraging more business from its existing client
base through its 
"
bundled
"
 service offering. The strengthening of our
management team, our continuing investment in technology and systems,
and our business acquisitions, will all be solid drivers for Adcorp
and reinforce the foundations for our future growth.
"


In light of the Company
'
s positive performance, the Board has
declared a fully franked final dividend of 3.5c per share, lifting
the total dividend to shareholders to 5.25c per share, this
represents an increase of 0.25c per share over the dividend projected
in Adcorp
'
s Prospectus.

For further information, please contact Ian Rodwell, Managing
Director, on (02) 9269 1300.

ADV GROUP LIMITED
Sydney
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

This letter is intended to introduce to you the resolutions proposed
in this Notice of Meeting and to outline the Board
'
s future strategy
and plans.

ADV Group proposes to expand its operations in China and Hong Kong
(Greater China) and for this purpose and for payment of existing
creditors, funding its past and future working capital and capital
expenditure requirements, the company requires more cash. Your
Directors consider that the best way of obtaining this cash is for an
initial public offering of shares on the Hong Kong Growth Equities
Market combined with a debt to equity conversion in respect of
certain existing indebtedness of its existing operating companies.

NJI No 2 Investment Fund is an existing shareholder in the ADV Group.
It or other venture capital funds managed by JAFCO Investment (Asia
Pacific) Limited are prepared to provide pre IPO capital to assist in
the development of the ADV Group
'
s Greater China operations through
the issue of certain Convertible Bonds, as summarised in the
Explanatory Memorandum.

Your Directors consider that this funding from NJI No 2 Investment
Fund offers the Company the best opportunity in the short term to
develop its operations in Greater China to a stage where an IPO in
Hong Kong is possible and to satisfy its past and future working
capital and capital expenditure requirements, including the payment
of certain creditors of the group. The Company has certain creditors
in respect of the ADV Group
'
s China businesses and if the funding is
not obtained then the solvency of those China businesses and the
entities which operate them is at risk.

Investor interest in Asia generally, and particularly in China has
been strengthening recently as parts of Asia emerge from the 
"
Asian
Economic Crisis
"
 and as China moves closer to entry to the World
Trade Organization.

When adequately funded, ADV Group will be well positioned to take
advantage of these trends having spent the past 5 years developing
strong business relationships in the region, not only through its
outdoor advertising operations but also through its general
involvement with government agencies and local business people.

However as previously reported to shareholders, Australian investors
appear to be reluctant to support capital raisings for investment in
Greater China, and likewise Asian investors appear to be reluctant to
support capital raisings for investment in Australia.

Your directors now consider it is time to foreshadow to shareholders
its immediate plans for the future of the ADV Group.

The following steps are planned for implementation before the end of
year 2000, subject to shareholders consent at General Meeting called
by this and other future Notices of Meeting:

1. A restructuring of ADV
'
s outdoor advertising interests in Greater
China into a new Asian holding company called China Media Network
(BVI) Limited (CMN BVI).

2. The compromise of a significant creditor of CMN BVI by the issue
to that creditor of equity in CMN BVI.

3. The proposed listing on a recognised Stock Exchange in Asia of CMN
BVI. Upon completion of this step, which will raise the capital
needed to fund the planned expansion of the outdoor advertising
operations in Greater China, ADV will hold approximately 40% of a
newly listed Asian group.

4. Extension of the existing media operations in Asia into the
information technology sector of media services, initially through an
exclusive agreement with the Guangdong Sports Development
Corporation, organiser of the 9th National Games, to develop and
construct a new Chinese 
"
Sports Portal
"
 to be known as iSports-China.

5. Following the recent disposal of the Adval Group, a search has
been commenced to identify a suitable business to become the future
Australian core business of the ADV Group. Several potential
opportunities have been identified and these are being examined at
present. Approval is sought for a share placement to fund a suitable
investment should due diligence presently being undertaken reach a
satisfactory result.

In conclusion, the Directors are confident that the new plan and
strategy outlined above will allow ADV Group to take full advantage
of the opportunities in both the Australian and Asian economies to
add value for the benefit of shareholders.

Given the strengthening levels of economic activity in the media
sector in Greater China, there is a good expectation that by adopting
the strategy outlined above the Board will be able to stabilise the
ADV Group and reach its original objectives in its media service
business in Greater China as outlined in its 1997 prospectus.

In the future, by segregation of investments into structures listed
in the respective regions, your Directors may be able to offer
shareholders the opportunity to either focus their investment in
their preferred countries, or to invest in both Australia and Greater
China.

We recommend the Resolutions in this Notice of Meeting to you as an
important step in meeting these objectives.

ALLEGIANCE MINING NL
Sydney
PREAMBLE

Allegiance Mining has made significant progress in the quarter under
review. The highlight was the acquisition of 100% ownership, subject
to a 2% NSR (Net Smelter Royalty) to Rio Tinto as Allegiance now
controls its own destiny. Excellent drilling results in our
PRE-FEASIBILITY STUDY (detailed below), plus a capital raising of
$1.7 million add to our increasing confidence.

As drilling progresses, it is becoming clear that at our original
Avebury discovery site (in the vicinity of drill hole A 001), we now
have three separate potential ore zones, namely, NORTH AVEBURY,
CENTRAL AVEBURY and SOUTH AVEBURY. In the current quarter, we will
concentrate on drilling out the RESOURCE at NORTH AVEBURY but where
practical, holes will be designed to also intersect the CENTRAL AND
SOUTH AVEBURY ZONES.

It is most gratifying that our Avebury deposits have attracted the
interest of a number of major nickel operators with whom we have had
technical discussions. These discussions confirm our view that the
simple mineralogy (sole sulphide being pentlandite), the favourable
geometry and rock characteristics together with the favourable
infrastructure, could mark Avebury as a unique deposit type with
considerable upside potential.

HIGHLIGHTS

Three very important events occurred in the June quarter with respect
to the Zeehan Nickel Project.

Firstly, joint venture partner Rio Tinto Exploration Pty Limited
elected to convert their 10% interest to a 2% NSR, thereby conferring
100% of the project on Allegiance.

Secondly, in response to the continuing encouraging drilling results,
the Board decided to complete a Pre-feasibility study on the Avebury
deposits. It is due for completion by end December 2000 at an
estimated cost of $1M.

And thirdly, the company made a placement of shares and options to
raise $1,729,852 to enable the above programme to be implemented with
financial comfort. 

These events are significant milestones for Allegiance and pave the
way for the accelerated ongoing evaluation and possible development
of the Avebury deposits.

The Pre-feasibility study will address a range of technical and
financial issues, and the final report will provide a clear picture
of the commercial potential of this project. A team of consultants
has been assembled and has already commenced work on the study.

Principal components are:

* an infill drilling program to facilitate estimation of an identified
  mineral resource at North Avebury.

* additional drilling into Central, South and East Avebury to 
  highlight the additional resource potential of these areas.

* mine design study to conceptualise and cost the style of mining
  operation that may be required to develop North Avebury.

* initial metallurgical test work on drill core samples to quantify
  recoveries and conceptualise the cost and style of a potential
  treatment plant.

* environmental scoping studies to identify environmental factors and
  issues in the area and to commence any long lead time environmental
  studies required.

* infrastructure study to review all infrastructure requirements and
  costs for an operational mine.

* marketing study to identify and evaluate options for Avebury
concentrates

AIRCRUISING AUSTRALIA LIMITED
Sydney
The recent occurrence of contamination of aviation fuel which
grounded some 5,000 aircraft in Australia does not affect Aircruising
Australia Ltd.

Aircruising Australia operate two (2) aircraft being a one hundred
series Fokker F27 and one BA31 series Jetstream aircraft. Neither of
these aircraft are subject to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority
(CASA) directives as both aircraft are Turbine engine powered, i.e.
they do not use 100/130 Avgas that was the contaminated fuel.

Both of the Aircruising Australia Ltd aircraft use a Kerosene-based
fuel known as Avter, which is an entirely different refining process.
This fuel has been free of any contamination that could have an
effect on airworthiness of an aircraft since the introduction of the
turbine engines using Avter commercially in Australia.

The contamination was discovered on the 23rd December 1999 and only
effected piston engined aircraft which were refuelled with 100/130
Avgas which was released by Mobil between 21st November 1999 and 23rd
December 1999.

Brierley investments Limited (

discussions with both Singapore Airlines Limited and Qantas Airways

received expressions of interest on its stake from other parties.

BIL considers that the First priority is to ensure that Air New
Zealand successfully moves to full ownership of Ansett Holdings
Limited.

BIL is also of the view that ultimately Air New Zealand would benefit
from having a strategic relationship with another airline through its
share register, but in the meantime it has withdrawn its stake from
sale.

HAZELTON AIRLINES LIMITED

The Board of Hazelton Airlines met today.

After having considered:

(1) the terms of the Qantas Offer;

(2) the terms of the Ansett Offer;

(3) the Qantas Announcement of 12 December 2000; and

(4) all other matters that the directors consider to be relevant

each of the directors of Hazelton recommends that shareholders take
no action in relation to the Qantas Offer and that:

(a) shareholders wait for the foreshadowed revised bid from Qantas;
and

(b) unless a revised Qantas bid higher than \$1.35 is received by 28
December 2000, or a higher offer than the Ansett offer is made by a
third party, the Ansett offer of \$1.35 be accepted.

The reasons for the directors
'
 recommendation are:

(1) the events referred to above

(2) a price of \$1.35 per share or higher represents fair value for
shareholders.

Separately, Hazelton today received notification from Ansett that

"
should Ansett not succeed in acquiring 100% of the Hazelton shares
following the close of Ansett
'
s bid, Ansett would not seek to remove
Hazelton Airlines Limited from the official list of the ASX.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY

The past quarter cashflows reveal the maturing of the key network
build in Perth, Adelaide, and Darwin. The roll-out phase, whilst
still occurring in Hobart, will not continue at the financial scale
shown in the past quarter, when the company spent around \$3.5 million
on fibre roll-out and switching equipment (1.9 d)

Receipts from customers in the cashflow statement omit accrual
revenues per a P
&
L approach.

A look at the quarterly P
&
L to September reveals sales levels
reaching over \$1.85 million for the quarter. This growth should see
the company on line to deliver a forecast turnover of around \$10
million in this its first full financial year of carrier sales, and
deliver a positive EBITDA. The size and reach of the metro networks
now built, and the scale of the sales and service operations
developed, indicate that the sales levels are at a very early stage
relative to the sales levels can be serviced.

The settlement of recent acquisition Rescue Management Pty Ltd will
also begin to contribute in this current quarter.

The sales target excludes inter-capital sales on the long haul routes
leased from Telstra, which should produce a minimum of around \$4 - 6
million in sales, rising as our own long haul build is completed. The
long haul business is contained within our IP1 subsidiary whose main
business is the building of a new generation optic fibre network
between Melbourne and Perth.

In recognition of the maturity of the build in Perth, the company is
now focused on the generation of sales on the network. Therefore new
capex per customer connection should be minimised to between
\$3000-\$6000 which provides a payback period on incremental capex cost
of sales of less than a year.

Further to our release of 11 September 2000, after detailed
negotiations with the vendors the directors of Amlink have decided to
formally withdraw their offer to acquire the USA competitor, as a
purchase price with a satisfactory positive earning per share could

ASIA PACIFIC SPECIALTY CHEMICALS LIMITED
Sydney
* \$5.2m operating profit after tax before abnormals

* Revenue up 5.3% to \$230 million

* EBITDA up 8.7% to \$15.2 million before abnormals

* Working capital down 6.5%

* 7% return on shareholders equity

Asia Pacific Speciality Chemicals (APS), the leading supplier of
specialties, additives and ingredients in Australia and New Zealand
today announced an operating profit of \$5.2 million before abnormals
(\$4.8 million after abnormals) on revenue of \$230 million. (Abnormals
were \$348,000 after tax compared with \$334,000 last year.)

Earnings before interest and tax, depreciation and amortisation
(
"
EBITDA
"
) before abnormals totalled \$15.2 million, an 8.7% increase
compared to the same period last year. Operating profit before
abnormals at \$5.2 million was lower than 1998 by \$670,000.


"
Generally tight trading conditions in the chemical sector made 1999
a difficult year,
"
 said APS Chairman, Tom Preston. 
"
Profitability was
adversely impacted by expenses associated with capital investment and
the implementation of a new market-focused organisational structure
designed to improve the company
'
s long term profitability.


"
The impact of these in these short term was to distort our operating
results and, in November, the Board notified the Australian Stock
Exchange and all shareholders that it estimated the profit after tax
of the company for 1999 would be significantly lower than that
reported for 1998.


"
I am now able to report that both November and December produced
higher sales, improved margins and containment of expenses that
contributed to a better result than was expected at the time of the
November announcement.

The Board has approved a final dividend of four cents per share due
to be paid on 19 May 2000. This brings the annual dividend to seven
cents per share, fully franked.

Turnovers in each of the three business groups were:

* Polymerics - \$79 million approx. (including plastics, polymer and
rubber, surface coatings, adhesive manufacturers and construction,
and textiles and leather);

* Fine Sciences - \$65 million approx. (food and nutrition,
healthcare, personal care and hygiene, and analytical and research);
and

* Specialities - \$86 million approx. (process industries, watercare,
contract manufacturing, retail and industrial distribution and
regional development).


"
1999 was a year of substantial change at APS,
"
 said APS Managing
Director, Mr Donald Hector. 
"
The new structure is operational and we
have delivered on the commitments made in our last report to improve
working capital efficiency and cash flow, achieve results from
improving our procurement function and to re-focus the business on
market opportunities that deliver value.


"
We have also improved our business information through a new IT
system in preparation for e-commerce opportunities and the GST.


"
Our outlook for the year ahead remains cautiously optimistic as
increased cost control and market focus are expected to mitigate
against the low margins experienced across the sector,
"
 he said.


"
We are confident of our long term prospects and plan to maintain our
focus on improving the return on our existing operations, while
moving towards higher value, more complex technologies mid reducing
our exposure to commodities.
"

ARB CORPORATION LIMITED
Melbourne
CHAIRMAN
'
S ADDRESS CONTINUED

During the year we released a new range of front vehicle protection
bars known as 
"
Sahara Bars
"
. We have provided a brochure for you
today showing this product fitted to a Nissan Patrol. The product
incorporates urethane buffers and light inserts and features a highly
polished chrome top tube. The high tooling costs associated with this
product will make it very difficult for others to copy. At present we
only build the product for a small number of 4WD
'
s but the range will
be increased dramatically over the next year or two.

The product is also much easier to ship than the conventional ARB
Bull Bar range. We believe this product range will have a great
future both locally and overseas. Initial sales volumes have been
very encouraging.

The 2000 year saw exports to our US subsidiary and to other export
markets continue to grow strongly. Exports now represent 34% of the
companies business of which just over 50% is sold via our US
operation. Over the year we added some interesting new customers to
our export list. New customers were established in Russia, the
Ukraine, China and the Canary Islands. We now export regularly to
over 50 countries worldwide. The low value of the Australian Dollar
during the year certainly assisted in our export growth and continues
to do so. 

One other important change was made during the year. In February the
company appointed a new Manufacturing Manager to oversee all our
manufacturing operations at Kilsyth.

This appointment has proved to be very successful and we now have a
very cohesive and efficient manufacturing operation. This is vitally
important as the future of ARB will rely more and more on in-house
manufacturing. In summary the 2000 year was a excellent one for the
company. The sales and profit growth were excellent and contributed
to by all divisions of the company.

We are happy to report that the 2000/2001 year has started very well.
Sales to the end of September 2000 were \$17.1 million compared to \$14
million in the corresponding period last year. This is an increase of
22%. Gross profit margins have been maintained and operating costs
are under control so operating profits should have increased by at
least a similar percentage. To provide for growth over the new few
years we have decided to increase the size of our facility at
Kilsyth. We have had designed a 3000 sq meter extension to the
warehouse. This addition will be used for assembly operations,
currently housed in the factory, and for additional warehouse area.
The building will be completed during this financial year and will be
funded from cash flow. 

We are also pleased to announce that we have just released the
portable ARB freezer/fridge range to the Australian market. This
product was released in the US market 12 months ago by our USA
subsidiary Air Locker Inc.

The product is manufactured by Sawafugi Electric Co in Japan for ARB
Corporation. We are confident this product will provide excellent
sales and profit growth for ARB in the future.

One of the company
'
s most important products is the ARB Air Locker
range. We now manufacture in excess of 12,000 units per year of which
85% are exported. We currently produce 70 different part numbers of
Air Lockers. Most of the part numbers have proved to be extremely
strong and reliable however a couple of part numbers have not sold
well as they have not proved reliable enough in heavy applications.
In response to this problem our engineers have designed a new 2 piece
high strength Air Locker. This development has taken 2 years to
complete and exhaustive testing has proved we have well and truly
overcome our strength and reliability problems. The new product is
being patented in the USA and will be released at the SEMA show in
Las Vegas in early November this year. We already have a large number
of back orders for the new Air Locker and we are confident this new
development will see Air Locker sales continue to grow over the next
few years. 

ARB has gained the reputation of being one of the world leaders in
the supply of high quality 4WD accessories to our customers. Our
marketing department over the years has certainly helped tremendously
in maintaining and enhancing this reputation. The consistent high
quality of our advertising, catalogues, brochures and packaging have
directly contributed to our strong sales growth. We are pleased to
announce that the marketing department have just completed a very
comprehensive web site for ARB Corporation Ltd and its distributors.
We are confident that this site will provide further growth for the
Company. The web address is www.arb.com.au.

As you may be aware, there has been recent publicity concerning the
regulation of bull bars in Australia. Consequently, a draft
Australian/New Zealand Standard for vehicle frontal protection
systems has been released for public comment and is likely to be
introduced next year. 

This standard sets out controls for the design of bull bars and we
believe it will be of benefit to the industry and consumers if
sensible requirements are adopted in the published standard.

John Forsyth and our engineering group are working closely with the
standards committee to ensure we are kept up dated with all future
requirements. 

Another important legislative matter which will be important to the 
future of ARB is the new ACIS scheme. 

ARB has benefited from the Federal government
'
s Export Facilitation
Scheme over the past six years. Our excellent export sales growth has
been assisted by this scheme. The Export Facilitation Program ends on
31st December 2000 and is to be replaced with the Automotive
Competitiveness and Investment Scheme which commences on 1st January
2001. We are hopeful that the new scheme will provide benefits to ARB
comparable with the current program but at present the regulations
which govern the new act are not finalised. Until these regulations
are published we cannot predict the benefits of the new scheme in
relation to ARB.

We have been advised that the relevant application forms for the
scheme will be available in the next few weeks.

One final point the directors would like to mention which will be of
interest to all our shareholders.

The company has a franking credit account of \$9.4 million as at 30th
June 2000. The directors are at present considering the various
options to transfer the benefits of these credits to shareholders.
Further advice on this matter will be given to shareholders within
the next 3
months

As Warrant-Issuer, Macquarie Bank Limited provides the following
information in relation to the period ending 31 October 2000.

These warrants have been adjusted due to a Scheme of Arrangement by
BHP under which they floated the long steel products division, after
receiving shareholder and court approval.

On 31 August 2000 BHP announced its intention to float its steel long
products business via a Capital Reduction and Scheme of Arrangement.

Under the terms of the Capital Reduction the share capital of each
fully paid BHP share was reduced by \$0.66. Under the Scheme of
Arrangement, the proceeds of the Capital Reduction were compulsorily
applied to the transfer of OneSteel Limited (
"
OneSteel
"
) shares to
holders of fully paid BHP shares in the ratio of one OneSteel share
for every four fully paid BHP shares held.

The scheme received shareholder approval on 17 October 2000 and court
approval on 18 October 2000.

Clause 4.1 of the Terms of Issue of the Endowment Warrants state that
the cash return of capital proposed by BHP under the scheme is to be
treated as a Reduction Amount.

The value of the Reduction Amount that has been applied to the
Outstanding Amount of the Portfolio Endowment Warrants is one quarter
of the value of the OneSteel shares multiplied by the number of BHP
shares in the Portfolio. The value of the OneSteel shares is defined
as their weighted average price, in accordance with clause 4.2(a)
terms of the Offering Circular.

The Reduction Amount applied to the Outstanding Amount is shown in
the table below.

The number of BHP shares in the underlying parcel for this Endowment
Warrant is unaffected by this scheme.

For the period from 1 October 2000 to 31 October 2000, the following
Reduction Amounts were paid in respect of the shares in the Portfolio

BENDIGO BANK LIMITED

ELDERS RURAL SERVICES LIMITED ENDS FIRST 12 MONTHS WITH \$700 MILLION
ADVANCED TO RURAL PRODUCERS

Riding a strong surge in deposits, rural financial services provider
Elders Rural Services Limited (ERSL) today reported a significantly
stronger second half to complete its first 12 months of operation.

The company, which commenced business on January 4, 1999, is a 50/50
joint venture between Futuris Corporation Limited and Bendigo Bank.

Chairman John Dawkins says building on the solid foundation of its
first six months, ERSL lifted operating profit by 50% for its second
six months from \$6.2 million to S9.3 million. The increase in profit
has been due to an expanding client base, and cost efficiencies
achieved through the direct support of its shareholders.

After tax profit was \$5.7 million compared with \$3.8 million for the
first six months.

Mr Dawkins says ERSL managed deposits lifted from \$354.5 million at
June 30, 1999, to \$405.4 million at December 31. Managed loan assets
rose from \$667.8 million to \$708.6 million for the corresponding
period.


"
Our strong first 12 months reflect the commitment of ERSL to
investing money in rural Australia and the awareness and acceptance
of this strategy by our client base,
"
 Mr Dawkins says.


"
With our application for a banking licence pending, we have been
encouraged by both the confidence of people in depositing with us and
using our financial services and in the assets and profitability we
have achieved,
"
 he says.


"
The message is clear: ERSL is working to make it easier for
investors to lodge deposits and at the same time to unlock the
financial potential for rural and regional Australia.
"

STILLWATER PGM JOINT-VENTURE, MONTANA, USA 

The directors are pleased to announce that formal Montana State
approval was granted for a drilling programme on the company
'
s
joint-venture project with Idaho Consolidated Metals Corp (ICMC) in
the Stillwater Complex. The drilling programme, to be carried out by
ICMC, will begin soon to explore for Platinum Group Metals (PGM) on
ground that was previously drilled and shown to contain significant
nickel/copper/cobalt mineralisation. A drill-tested resource of 92
million tonnes grading 0.7% nickel, 0.7% copper and 0.07% cobalt is
estimated. Only limited analyses for PGM have been done in the past.
The site is located less than 1 km southeast of Stillwater Mining
Company
'
s main mine, which last year produced 409,000 ounces of PGM.
The Stillwater Mine is the world
'
s richest grade PGM operation.

A 2000 line-km EM survey was completed Monday, 15 May and covered the
entire Stillwater Complex, including all of the ground controlled by
the company.

The company will closely follow the exploration programme in Montana
and will keep the market informed of results and new developments.

OPTION ENTITLEMENTS ISSUE

The prospectus for the Option Entitlements Issue is near completion
and will be lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments

COMMENT

As indicated in the December 1999 interim results, the third quarter 
of the financial year does not include the main seasonal peaks.  
Despite this factor, the Company is pleased to announce highly 
satisfactory group results for the first nine months of the current 
financial year.

Shareholders interest is stated after the cumulative deduction of 
GBP69.8 million (June 30 1999 - GBP67.0 million) in respect of 
goodwill written off.

OPERATIONS

3883 FIRST FOR FOODSERVICE

The first nine months of the year has produced a strong performance 
as a result of the commitment of management, which has impacted 
favourably on the operations.  Operating profit has improved due to 
higher margins in the wholesale division and solid trading from the 
Ministry of Defence division.  The Central Distribution division is in
the process of transforming its mode of operation from a shared user 
to an open book arrangement which is similar to the Ministry of 
Defence operation.  The effects of this transition will be negative on
the Central Distribution division
'
s results for this year, but 
positive thereafter.

BIDVEST AUSTRALIA

The results for the first nine months of the financial year have been 
pleasing and the positive trend shown in the first half continued 
with trading strongly ahead of the previous year.  Bidvest Australia 
continues to consolidate its position as one of the leading 
foodservice distributors in Australia and has recently acquired 
Warramba Foodservice, a foodservice business in Melbourne, to further 
consolidate its position as the leading national distributor.

BIDVEST NEW ZEALAND

The Company has acquired, with effect from April 1 2000, the total 
foodservice business of Creans Foodservice, one of the largest 
foodservice distributors in New Zealand.

PROSPECTS

Management remains confident that the expected trading for the last 
three months of the financial year should result in a highly 
satisfactory performance for the financial year.

The Group has a strong balance sheet which will facilitate growth 
organically and by acquisition.

DIVIDENDS

It is Company policy to pay dividends after the end of each six month 
period.

SUMMARY OF ANNOUNCEMENT

Farm-in and Joint Venture Agreement with BHP Minerals Pty Ltd

DETAILS OF ANNOUNCEMENT

The Company is pleased to announce that it has entered into a Farm-in
and Joint Venture agreement with BHP Minerals Pty Ltd (
"
BHPM
"
) over
BHPM
'
s King George Prospect, located approximately 20 kilometres west
of Moonta, in the Spencer Gulf of South Australia and covered by 
ELA 2000/25.

The King George Prospect is a high order gravity/magnetic anomaly
that was identified by a survey utilising BHPM
'
s Falcon airborne
gravity gradiometer system and has strong empirical similarities, in
geological character, to the Olympic Dam uranium/copper/gold deposit
located to the north, in the same structural corridor.

Under the terms of the agreement the Company is required to drill
three cored holes into the complex, to an agreed depth, at its sole
cost, to earn a 50 per cent interest in the project. Thereafter both
parties can either continue to fund further exploration expenditure
on a 50:50 basis or elect not to contribute and dilute their interest
in the project according to an agreed formula. 

Whilst the Company recognises the drilling of offshore targets
represents significant economic risks and technical challenges it
believes the potential rewards associated with the discovery of an
Olympic Dam style deposit present an opportunity that should not be
missed.

In addition the Company recognises the value of BHPM
'
S new Falcon
technology in delineating such a high order anomaly and believes
there is a strong possibility that drilling will confirm
mineralisation.

ANALYSIS OF BHP/MITSUBISHI STATEMENTS IN THEIR 5 OCTOBER LETTER TO
QRL SHAREHOLDERS

BHP and Mitsubishi have argued that the Grant Samuel valuation
represents a significant premium to the historic QRL share price.
This is not relevant given latest forecasts, Grant Samuel
'
s
independent valuation and the improved outlook for the coal industry.

* While BHP and Mitsubishi keep comparing MetCoal
'
s Offer to past
stock prices for QRL, the independent expert, Grant Samuel, has
valued QRL shares in the range of \$1.57 to \$1.89, at least 31% higher
than the Offer price of \$1.20.

* The majority of independent stockbroking analysts are now saying
that the value of QRL shares to the bidder is at or in excess of
\$1.53 per share, ie at least 28% higher than the Offer price.

BHP and Mitsubishi have argued for a lower value based on a different
exchange rate assumption to that used by Grant Samuel, without
assuming a corresponding change in US\$ coal prices. Their argument
and methodology are wrong. 

* Grant Samuel have correctly shown that exchange rates and US\$ coal
price movements are inter-related. In the Target
'
s Statement (at page
62), Grant Samuel says: 
"
Export coal prices have been projected in A\$
terms. In Grant Samuel
'
s opinion, long term coal prices in \$A terms
are more meaningful given the interdependence between US\$ coal prices
and the A\$/US\$ exchange rate. They cannot be forecast independently.
"

Importantly, Grant Samuel have in fact used falling long term real
coal prices as the basis of their valuation.

* The claims and resoning of BHP and Mitsubishi on this issue are 
wrong and should be ignored.

BHP and Mitsubishi say that prices paid in previous CQCA transactions
are not relevant. QRL strongly disagrees. 

* The nominal A\$ coal price has been relatively consistent over the
period of these transactions as shown on the graph on page 42 of the
Target
'
s Statement.

* The current environment is also one in which in which joint Venture
cash costs have decreased substantially from \$49.40/tonne in FY1997
to \$37.70/tonne in FY2000, and are forecast to continue to decrease
to less than \$35/tonne in 2001. QRL believes comparison with previous
transactions is indeed relevant and argues that the Joint Ventures
are in a better position than they have been for many years with the
coal industry coming off a low point in the cycle. These factors
support a higher transaction multiple rather than the lower multiple
offered by MetCoal.

BHP and Mitsubishi say the MetCoal Offer price is at a material
premium to the A\$ per saleable tonne per annum multiple implied in
Anglo American
'
s acquisition of Shell Coal. This is not a fair or
relevant comparison.

* MetCoal
'
s comparison is not valid. It is simply not reasonable to
compare a Shell Coal forecast production multiple for 2003 with the
current production multiple implied by the MetCoal Offer. It is
highly speculative to suggest that the Shell Coal assets as purchased
by Anglo American are capable of sustaining 50% greater production.
It should be noted that the Grant Samuel valuation of QRL did not
factor in production growth for the Joint Venture operations.

BHP and Mitsubishi claim that the value ascribed by Grant Samuel to
South Blackwater is unrealistic. They refer to the expiry of cross
border mining arrangements over the Blackwater mining lease, and have
expressed significant reservations as to the viability of the new
production areas and depletion of other existing operations. QRL
strongly disagrees.

* BHP and Mitsubishi have sought to imply that continuation of the
cross-border mining arrangement with the CQCA Joint Venture
'
s
Blackwater mine is key to South Blackwater
'
s value. This is not the
case. South Blackwater
'
s mine plan only envisages mining a small
volume of coal from this area for about four months following the
expiry of the current arrangement. In fact the current negotiations
between BHP Coal and QRL principally relate to the reverse situation,
ie mining by CQCA Blackwater of up to 2 million tonnes of coal from
the South Blackwater leases. The continuation of the Blackwater
mining arrangement is not a significant component of Grant Samuel
'
s
valuation of South Blackwater.

* BHP and Mitsubishi continue to focus on last year
'
s problem at
Kenmare even though this has been addressed. From this month, South
Blackwater is expected to return to historically normal levels of
production, of more than 5 million tonnes per year of highly sought
after coal. In arriving at its independent valuation, Grant Samuel
specifically took into account the 
"
specific operating and reserves
parameters for South Blackwater and the potential impact of the
circumstances surrounding the abandonment of longwall mining in Seam
C at the Kenmare underground mine and relocation of the longwall
equipment to Seam A
"
.

* South Blackwater is clearly an asset of significant value, 
especially in a rising market.

BHP and Mitsubishi claim that QRL attributes significant value to its
ability to separately market its share of Joint Venture coal.
Furthermore, BHP and Mitsubishi have argued that any third party
offeror seeking to take advantage of the right to separately market
QRL
'
s share of production will incur significant cost and price
disadvantages. They want QRL shareholders to ignore the strategic
value to BHP and Mitsubishi of securing control over QRL
'
s share of
the Joint Ventures.

* The Grant Samuel valuation of \$1.57 to \$1.89 per share does not
attribute any financial value to QRL
'
s right to separately market its
share of Joint Venture coal production. However, the right has
strategic importance. Should BHP and Mitsubishi take control of QRL,
they will have eliminated the threat of a strong competitor in the
coking coal market and strengthened their position in future price
negotiations. The current Offer price fails to reflect the
fundamental value of QRL as determined by the independent expert, nor
does it reflect the strategic value at risk to BHP in expanding or
maintaining its share of the world export coking coal market.

* QRL rejects the assertion that separate marketing of its coal will
necessarily incur significant cost and price disadvantages.

BHP and Mitsubishi say MetCoal has made an appropriate allowance for
synergies in its Offer price.

* Given that MetCoal
'
s Offer of \$1.20 per share is less than Grant
Samuel
'
s independent valuation and below the values of most
stockbroking analysts, there is no evidence that the value of any
possible synergies have been incorporated into the Offer price.

BHP and Mitsubishi have argued that QRL has suffered from hedging
losses and problems at South Blackwater. These have been addressed
and are quantified in the Directors
'
 forecast for FY2001.

* QRL
'
s past performance and current hedge book have been expressly
taken into account in the Grant Samuel valuation.

Grant Samuel has reviewed BHP and Mitsubishi
'
s 5 October letter to
QRL shareholders, and has confirmed that nothing in the letter
changes its conclusion that the Offer of \$1.20 per share is neither
fair nor reasonable. 

In summary, BHP and Mitsubishi want shareholders to look to the past.
At \$1.20 per share, they are asking QRL shareholders to give up much
of the value of the future performance of the joint Venture mines as
well as QRL
'
s other assets, just as the industry outlook is turning
positive for the first time in several years.

DEUTSCHE BANK AG
Sydney
We advise that Deutsche Bank proposes to make a adjustment to the
Underlying Parcel for this warrant series.

WHY IS THIS ADJUSTMENT NECESSARY?

BHP has received court, approval to transfer to its shareholders one
OneSteel Limited (
"
OneSteel
"
) share for every four BHP shares
currently held. This will be effected by a reduction in the share
capital of BHP of \$0.66 for each BHP share and the compulsory
application of substantially all of the proceeds of the capital
reduction towards the transfer of all of the issued capital of
OneSteel to BHP shareholders.

HOW WILL THE ADJUSTMENT BE MADE?

In order to maintain a warrant solely over BHP shares, Deutsche Bank
will make an adjustment to the number of BHP shares a warrantholder
will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Required Number of
Warrants. The terms of this adjustment are consistent with that
proposed to be adopted by the Australian Stock Exchange for exchange
traded options in relation to BHP. The Australian Stock Exchange has
also given its consent to Deutsche Bank making an adjustment in this
manner.

The Underlying Parcel will be adjusted in accordance with the
following formula:

Number of BHP Shares in the Underlying Parcel = 
                                       1 + (0.25 x VWAP of OneSteel)
                                       -----------------------------
                                         (VWAP of BHP ex - OneSteel)

where VWAP means the volume weighted average price of the relevant
security on 23 October 2000.

The Required Number of Warrants will remain at 4.

A further announcement setting out the number of BHP shares in the
Underlying Parcel will be made shortly after 23 October 2000.

MARKETING

Bigshop is working on a number of online direct marketing strategies
to deliver a more effective allocation of resources to advertising
and promotion by building on its own database of customers.

Bigshop is currently negotiating with an online direct marketing
company, to commercially exploit their 2.5 million Australian
Internet users obtained through permissive online advertising.
Bigshop has already developed its own substantial database of
Internet addresses of interested users Australia wide.

EXPENDITURE

At the end of the quarter Bigshop engaged a number of its consultants
as full-time employees which significantly reduced the labour costs
and curbed expenditure. At 1 July 2000 Bigshop had seven employees
and two full time contractors. It is anticipated that the future
day-to-day running expenses and operational costs of the company, now
that the float costs and upfront capital expenditure for software
development has been incurred, will be around \$80,000 per month.

In addition, a net saving of approximately \$180,000 per annum to the
company and the cancellation of an executive option package of some
four million options exercisable at 25 cents each was achieved
through the review and subsequent reduction in consultancy services.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

The software development costs have come in significantly lower than
budgeted, resulting in an expected saving of around \$300,000. This is
largely attributable to the ongoing software development being
brought in house. Bringing the software development in house has the
additional benefits of retaining intellectual property achieved
through the software development process as well as reductions in
ongoing software maintenance costs.

COMPETITORS

Bigshop has identified only four existing online department store
companies as being real future competitors. As such there are
currently only a relatively small number of competitors in the
Australia market place. Bigshop is the only publicly listed company
with its supply chain rationalisation business model.

DELIVERY

AUSTRALIA POST ALLIANCE

The Company has established an important strategic alliance with
Australia Post for its electronic fulfilment system and negotiated a
Bigshop delivery service and price. Products ordered from the Bigshop
website will be despatched using Australia Post
'
s Australia-wide
services. Australia Post has advised Bigshop that a complete
electronic fulfilment system (
"
E-Deliver
"
) will be in place by the
end of October 2000. Bigshop has developed its software system to
ensure that it will be able to interface with Australia Post.

SECURITY 

COMMSECURE - VERISIGN - NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK ALLIANCE

Bigshop uses a combination of CommSecure, Verisign and NAB to provide
a fully integrated secure payment system.

Bigshop uses 128 bit-encryption to ensure all credit card details
cannot be intercepted and deciphered during transmission. Where
browsers do not support 128 bit-encryption, 40 bit-encryption is
used.

POST 30 JUNE 2000

AUSTRALIAN STOCK EXCHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT 

Rumble Bigshop Heads of Agreement 

Bigshop has entered into a Heads of Agreement with Rumble Pty Ltd by
way of a merger. On the basis of the information presented to Bigshop
to date, the Board considers that a merger with Rumble will establish
an expanded, diversified e-commerce company that is well positioned
to enjoy significant potential future growth. It will also result in
synergies to exploit Bigshop
'
s core software platform.

Rumble comprises two principal activities being a fast growing
digital strategy consulting business operating as Rumble Logic Pty
Limited (Rumble Logic), and an intellectual property oriented
products and ventures incubator operating within Rumble Products Pty
Limited (Rumble Products) and Rumble Ventures Pty Limited (Rumble
Ventures).

The digital strategy consulting business, Rumble Logic, has seen
revenues grow from \$750,000 in the period to June 1999, to over
\$1,500,000 for the period to June 2000, and substantial continued
growth is expected. Rumble Logic has been engaged on projects with
clients such as Goodman Fielder, Carter Holt Harvey, NRMA, BT Funds
Management, Ricoh Endeavour Credit Union and Community First Credit
Union. Most recently the company has been engaged, along with Arthur
Andersen, to work on a major project for Open Telecommunications
Limited.

Rumble Ventures
'
 activities involve significant stakes in new
e-commerce oriented companies in return for initial project
definition and strategic support and advice as well as development
and technical support. Under these arrangements support services are
provided by Rumble Logic on a full commercial basis including normal
fees.

Rumble Products owns and is developing 3 new products covering web
site management, non credit card on-line payments and a knowledge
management tool. These products are to be licensable or saleable and
are fully Internet enabled.

In summary, the Board considers that a merger with the Rumble Group
will establish an expanded, diversified e-commerce company that is
well positioned to enjoy significant growth potential. It will also
result in synergies to exploit the licensing opportunities of
Bigshop
'
s core online software retailing platform.

Full details of the agreement are contained in the Australian Stock
Exchange announcement attached hereto.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion Bigshop during its first Quarter has significantly
advanced its business plan activities whilst rationalising its
administration and overheads and is now well placed to take advantage
of the growing online trading market as its competitors are being
diminished.

BIOTECH INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
Brisbane
AGEN Biomedical Limited, subsidiary of listed Australian
biotechnology company Biotech International Limited, today filed a
lawsuit in the USA against Biopool International Inc for infringement
of a D-dimer patent owned by AGEN.

The legal action, filed in US District Court in San Francisco
California alleges that Biopool
'
s manufacture and sale in the USA of
D-dimer test kits infringes AGEN
'
s US patent.

D-dimer is a molecule specific to blood clots and AGEN
'
s patents,
issued in the USA, Europe and Japan, cover testing for D-dimer to
diagnose blood clot conditions.

As a result of pioneering work in the early 1980
'
s and extensive
clinical trials supported by AGEN, D-dimer testing has become an
internationally accepted standard in the diagnosis of blood clot
conditions. Mr Roman Zwolenski, AGEN
'
s Managing Director, said 
"
the
world market for D-dimer diagnostic test kits is presently around \$50
million per annum and growing steadily.
"


AGEN has made very substantial scientific and commercial investments
to advance the use of D-dimer as a clot diagnostic marker. Several
major companies have licensed the AGEN technology and sell D-dimer
test kits manufactured by AGEN. 
"
It is time unlicensed companies
recognise and respect AGEN
'
s valid patent positions
"
, Mr Zwolenski
said.

Biotech International Chairman, Mr David Fawcett, said 
"
the company
is fully committed to protecting its key intellectual property such
as the D-dimer patents
"
.

Over the past few months Biotech International has taken an 8.9%
stake in Biopool, whose stock trades in the USA on the OTC bulletin
board (trading code BIPL). 
"
Whilst we have a strategic interest in
Biopool because of the logical fit with our AGEN operation, we are
not prepared to stand by and allow anyone to cash in on a market that
our company has been developing over many years

BLIGH OIL
Brisbane
Bligh Oil 
&
 Minerals N.L. advises that it has entered into a letter
of intent with Nuevo Energy Company, Houston (
"
Nuevo
"
) with respect
to a sale of Bligh
'
s interest in the Anaguid Permit in Southern
Tunisia, and a partial farmout of Bligh
'
s interest in the Fejaj
Permit in central Tunisia. Preparation of a definitive purchase and
sale agreement and a farmout agreement are under way.

On the Anaguid Permit, Bligh has agreed to sell its 20.84% working
interest to Nuevo for the sum of US\$3 million (A\$4.9 million). In
addition to the sale proceeds, Bligh will retain a proportionately
reducible share of a 1.00% overriding royalty on future production
generated by the Permit.

On the Fejaj Permit, Nuevo has agreed to bear 20.00% of Bligh
'
s
32.50% working interest in the forthcoming re-entry of the Chott
Fejaj #3 well, which will test for possible gas reserves in the Lower
Triassic and Upper Paleozoic sections, below the well
'
s current total
depth of 3500 metres. It is anticipated that the re-entry will be
deepened to approximately 4250 metres, at a cost in the range of
US\$2.5 million. The agreement with Bligh will increase Nuevo
'
s
interest in the Permit to 37.50%. Bligh has the right to re-purchase
7.50% working interest in any resulting discovery from Nuevo at cost.
Bligh plans to maintain its retained 12.50% working interest in the
deepening project, such that its ultimate interest in any commercial
discovery yielded by the Chott Fejaj #3 deepening will be 20.00%. It
is anticipated that the deepening will be carried out in the fourth
quarter of 2000 or first quarter of 2001. Pursuant to a request from
Nuevo, it is likely that Bligh will retain operatorship.

The agreements on both Permits are subject to the execution of the
definitive agreements above, approval of the respective Boards of
Directors of both Nuevo and Bligh, while the agreement on Anaguid is
additionally subject to the pre-emptive rights contained in the
Anaguid Joint Operating Agreement.

After a four year program of exploration on both Permits, involving
the acquisition of several hundreds of kilometres of seismic data,
and the drilling of four exploratory wells, Bligh continues to rate
the exploratory potential of both blocks highly, and this is
reflected in the sale price which has been secured. However, in view
of the high cost of ongoing operations, particularly the large
seismic acquisition program planned on the Anaguid Permit, Bligh
considers that its working capital resources should be preserved for
application on the development projects which the Company is pursuing
on its holdings on the Rimu project in New Zealand, the Bayou Choctaw
project in the United States, and the Block 22/12 project Offshore,
Peoples
'
 Republic of China. To this end, further farmouts of certain
of Bligh
'
s exploratory holdings in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand
are also being considered.

BNP PARIBAS
Sydney
On 27 October 2000, the share capital of Broken Hill Proprietary
Company Limited (
"
BHP
"
) was reduced by an amount equal to \$0.66 for
each BHP fully paid share and substantially all the proceeds of the
reduction were applied towards the transfer of all the shares in
OneSteel Limited to BHP fully paid shareholders. Holders of BHP fully
paid shares received one OneSteel quoted share for every four BHP
fully paid shares they held.

The Trustee under the Trust Deed for BHPIPA instalment warrants
received OneSteel shares under the scheme of arrangement and sold
these shares on the ASX market on 23 October 2000.

BNP Paribas and the Trustee propose to distribute the net proceeds of
this sale (after deduction of brokerage, stamp duty, transfer taxes
and costs to BNP Paribas) directly to each holder of a BNP Paribas
BHPIPA instalment warrant.

Each holder, for every four warrants they hold, will receive \$1.03
for each OneSteel share that was sold after deduction of brokerage,
stamp duly and expenses. The record date for holders eligible for
this distribution was October 27, 2000. 

After the distribution, the Underlying Parcel for the BNP Paribas
BHPIPA instalment warrant will continue to be one ordinary BHP share.

BNP Paribas and the Trustee have formed the opinion that it was not
clear what adjustment should be made for the Spin-Out. BNP Paribas
and the Trustee have therefore determined, subject to the ASX
'
s
consent that it is necessary or desirable to, specifically deal with
the consequences of the OneSteel Spin-Out, as outlined above. ASX has
consented to this adjustment in accordance with clause 23.1 of the 
Trust Deed.
 
Trading in BHPIPA with the Underlying Parcel consisting of one
ordinary BHP share will commence an Thursday November 2, 2000.

Please direct any queries regarding the BHPIPA instalment warrant to

BASS STRAIT OIL TRUST
Sydney
Enclosed for your information is a copy of a reply from a Senior
Advisor to Senator Rod Kemp to my letter of 10 December 1999, and a
copy of my response.

A F Batley
CHAIRMAN

Thank you for your facsimile of 10 December 1999 to the Assistant
Treasurer providing a submission on the impact of the Government
'
s
announced business tax reforms on the Bass Strait Oil Trust (BSOT).
The Assistant Treasurer has asked me to respond to your letter.

The Assistant Treasurer has noted your concern that the BSOT will not
be able to qualify as a collective investment vehicle (CIV) under the
reforms.

The Government is currently settling the details of legislation
associated with the CIV regime against the objectives of preserving
the policy basis of its announcements and maintaining the revenue
neutrality and integrity of the reforms. Your concerns will be
considered in this context.

I note that for entities that do not qualify for CIV status, being
taxed like a company will mean tax will be paid at the trust level
rather than at the unitholder level. However, tax paid at the trust
level will be imputed to the unitholders and any excess credits
refunded. Therefore, where the taxable income of the trust consists
solely of assessable income (such as a royalty), there should be no
change to the amount of tax paid.

Thank you for bringing your views to the attention of the Government.

J Jaques
SENIOR ADVISER - TAXATION

Thank you for your letter of 12 January 2000, in response to my
letter of 10 December 1999 to the Assistant Treasurer.

In the penultimate paragraph of your letter you have commented on the
consequences for the unitholders in the Bass Strait Oil Trust
(
"
BSOT
"
) in the event that it fails to qualify as a collective
investment vehicle (
"
CIV
"
). Unfortunately, due to the unique
structure of the BSOT, the consequences would not be as you have
described and there would be severe financial detriment caused to the
unitholders. The exact taxation consequences may not have been clear
from my previous letter, and therefore I am writing to you again to
provide further explanation in this regard.

As explained in the Appendix to my letter of 10 December 1999,
ordinary unitholders in the BSOT receive, each half-year, a
guaranteed return of 1/20 of the capital originally subscribed for
their units, together with their proportionate share of the royalty
income earned by the BSOT for that period. The component representing
the capital return is funded out of royalty income of the trust.
Refer to Appendix A for a diagram of a typical year
'
s funds flow.

For income tax purposes, the holder of residual units (Weeks
Resources Pty Limited, a subsidiary of Australian Consolidated
Investments Limited) is presently entitled to all of the income of
the trust up to an amount equivalent to the aggregate capital returns
to be made to the ordinary unitholders, with ordinary unitholders
being entitled to the balance. The Australian Taxation Office has
ruled that the residual unitholder is to be regarded as presently
entitled and thus assessable on such amounts, notwithstanding that
the income is not paid over to the residual unitholder but is instead
transferred to a provision for diminution in the capital value of the
Weeks Royalty (as provided under the trust deed establishing the
BSOT).

The effect of this is that the residual unitholder is assessed to
tax on the amount of the royalty income of the BSOT which is used to
fund the guaranteed capital returns to ordinary unitholders. The
ordinary unitholders are therefore not subject to tax on these
amounts but instead have the cost base of their units written down
(as explained in my previous letter). The trustee is thus able to pay
the full amount of the guaranteed capital returns to the ordinary
unitholders.

If the BSOT itself was subject to tax on the royalty income of the
trust up to the amount of the guaranteed capital returns, rather than
the residual unitholder being responsible for tax on that portion of
the trust income, the trust would not have the funds to pay the full
amount of the guaranteed capital returns to the ordinary unitholders.
Assuming a tax rate of 30%, the trust would only be able to pay 70%
of the guaranteed capital returns to the unitholders. Refer to
Appendix B for a diagram of a typical year
'
s funds flow under entity
taxation which demonstrates the capital redemption shortfall that
ordinary unitholders will suffer. 

It is important to note that there is no requirement for the residual
unitholder or any other party to make up this shortfall and the tax
paid by the trust would be imputed to the residual unitholder rather
than the ordinary unitholders.

The effect of the BSOT not qualifying as a CIV will therefore be
that in any given half-yearly period after 1 July 2001, the trustee
would only be in a position to pay to ordinary unitholders 70% of the
guaranteed capital returns, as the remaining 30% would have been paid
in income tax. (Under the present system, tax on such amounts is the
responsibility of the residual unitholder.) It is for this reason
that the ordinary unitholders, members of the public who invested in
the BSOT in good faith on the basis of the tax consequences as ruled
by the Commissioner of Taxation, will suffer significant financial
detriment if the BSOT is subjected to entity taxation.

I would therefore request again the opportunity to discuss with you,
as soon as possible and in any event before the relevant legislation
is finalised, any steps which may be taken to ensure the BSOT can
qualify for CIV status or the possibility of a specific exemption
being granted from entity taxation until the ordinary units in the
BSOT are redeemed in 2007. Accordingly I would appreciate it if you
would advise a suitable date for us to discuss the issue with you and
in anticipation, I have set down below some dates as an indication of
our availability: 

February 28th, March 6th, 7th, 8th, 13th, 14th, 21st, or 23rd.

Alternatively you may wish to contact Ms Debra Monks on (02) 9247
7000 to arrange a mutually convenient date. We look forward to
hearing from you.

AUSTRALIA
                                        1ST HALF   1ST HALF   CHANGE
                                            2000       1999        %

Sales volume (million unit cases)          123.9      122.9      0.8
Revenue from sales of beverages \$m         738.9      724.8      1.9
Cash operating profit \$m                   148.5      144.6      2.7
Trading profit \$m                          106.5      104.0      2.4
Capital expenditure / sales revenue %        4.1%       6.8% 


As we prepare for the Sydney Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, the
full promotional calendar (including the 
"
RedFest
"
 promotion launched
in June) in the second half of 2000 takes complete advantage of the
excitement and potential these events will generate in our market. We
remain focused on our objective of driving revenue and maintaining
momentum for the business during and, as importantly, after the
Games.

Volume growth of 0.8% was recorded in the first half of 2000. Second
quarter volume improved considerably over first quarter levels
primarily as a result of the shift in Easter related sales into April
in 2000 as compared to March in 1999, and the success of sales and
marketing promotions. The 
"
Big Buddy
"
 promotion and 
"
Feel Good with
Mount Franklin
"
 promotion have been very successful in generating
volume of 600mL PET for brand Coke and Mount Franklin water,
respectively.

Sales revenue increased by 1.9% to \$738.9 million. Net sales revenue
per case increased primarily as a result of continued shift towards
cold drink for immediate consumption, particularly in 600mL PET.

Cash operating profit increased by 2.7% and trading profit increased
by 2.4%. These improvements largely reflect cost control, continuous
improvements in productivity, as well as relatively low sugar and
resin costs, partly offset by increases in labour and fuel costs.
Margins are in line with those experienced in 1999.

The introduction of the Goods 
&
 Services Tax (
"
GST
"
) on 1 July 2000
was achieved at minimal cost to the business and without major
difficulties. CCA was one of the first Australian companies to enter
into a voluntary compliance agreement with the Australian Consumer
and Competition Commission in relation to the implementation of the
GST.

The ratio of capital expenditure to net sales revenue was 4.1%,
reflecting disciplined deployment of cold drink equipment, continued
investment in production facilities and equipment to gain
efficiencies and expenditure on enabling information systems.

OCEANIA (NEW ZEALAND, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, FIJI)

                                        1ST HALF   1ST HALF   CHANGE
                                            2000       1999        %

Sales volume (million unit cases)           29.8       29.5      1.0
Revenue from sales of beverages \$m         160.4      163.0     -1.6
Cash operating profit \$m                    30.5       28.2      8.2
Trading profit \$m                           21.6       19.2     12.5
Capital expenditure / sales revenue %       10.1%       4.4% 


Volume increased by 1.0% over prior year. The 1.6% decrease in sales
revenue in Australian dollar terms was due to the sharp depreciation
of the New Zealand dollar and Papua New Guinea kina. Net sales
revenue per case increased by 2.5% in local currency terms,
principally as a result of favourable package mix changes.

Cash operating profit increased by 8.2%, with a 12.5% increase in
trading profit. Margins strengthened (cash operating profit margin
from 17.3% to 19.0% and trading profit margin from 11.8% to 13.5%)
largely as a result of cost control.

The impact of the Fiji coup has not been significant on Oceania
'
s
volume and trading profit. It is not expected to have a major effect
on the Oceania region
'
s volume and trading profit for the year.

The ratio of capital expenditure to net sales revenue was 10.1%. The
size of this investment reflects the significant spending on cold
drink equipment in Papua New Guinea. This follows the licensing of
the Schweppes brands in that territory.

Sales volume (million unit cases)          200.8      203.9     -1.5
Revenue from sales of beverages \$m         584.2      554.8      5.3
Cash operating profit \$m                    60.9       82.2    -25.9

Capital expenditure / sales revenue %        3.5%      16.0%      

            
Although first half volume was 1.5% below last year, the second
quarter showed volume growth of 1.1% over the corresponding period
last year. Our marketing strategies are focused on providing value-
positioned brand and package offerings across all channels to
consumers and improving customer service and merchandising standards.
The competitive situation continues to be intense as competitors
pursue strategies focused on low price and limited package offerings.
Our share of the carbonated soft drink segment has remained stable
over the first half. However, the return to sustainable growth in the
Philippines business remains dependent on an improvement in consumer
sentiment,
which has yet to appear

   immediately? If not, why not and when is it expected that an
   announcement will be made?

   Please note, if the answer to question 1 is yes and an announcement
   cannot be made immediately, you need to contact us to discuss this
   and you need to consider a trading halt (see below).

3. Is there any other explanation that the Company may have for the
   price change in the securities of the Company?

4. Please confirm that the Company is in compliance with the listing
   rules and, in particular, listing rule 3.1.

Your response should be sent to me on facsimile number (07) 3832
4114. It should not be sent to the Company Announcements Office.

Unless the information is required immediately under listing rule
3.1, a response is requested as soon as possible and, in any event,
not later than half an hour before the start of trading (ie before
9.30am EST on Tuesday, 18 July 2000).

The response must be in a form suitable for release to the market. If
you have any concern about release of a response, please contact me
immediately.

LISTING RULE 3.1

Listing rule 3.1 requires an entity to give ASX immediately any
information concerning it that a reasonable person would expect to
have a material effect on the price or value of the entity
'
s
securities. The exceptions to this requirement are set out in the
rule.

In responding to this letter you should consult listing rule 3.1 and
the guidance note titled 
"

If the information requested by this letter is information required
to be given to ASX under listing rule 3.1 your obligation is to
disclose the information immediately.

Your responsibility under listing rule 3.1 is not confined to, or
necessarily satisfied by, answering the questions set out in this
letter.

TRADING HALT

If you are unable to respond by the time, requested, or if the answer
to question 1 is yes and an announcement cannot be made immediately,
you should consider a request for a trading halt in the Company
'
s
securities. As set out in listing rule 17.1 and the guidance note
titled 
"
Trading halts
"
 we may grant a trading halt at your request.
We may require the request to be in writing. We are not required to
act on your request. You must tell us each of the following.

* The reasons for the trading halt.
* How long you want the trading halt to last.
* The event you expect to happen that will end the trading halt.
* That you are not aware of any reason why the trading halt should
  not be granted.
* Any other information necessary to inform the market about the
  trading halt, or that we ask for.

The trading halt cannot extend past the commencement of normal
trading on the second day after the day on which it is granted. If a
trading halt is requested and granted and you are still unable to
reply to this letter before the commencement of trading, suspension
from quotation would normally be imposed by us from the commencement
of trading if not previously requested by you. The same applies if
you have requested a trading halt because you are unable to release
information to the market, and are still unable to do so before the
commencement of trading.

If you have any queries regarding any of the above, please let me
know.

CAMBRIDGE CONSOLIDATED NL
Perth
CORPORATE OVERVIEW

Today, with your consent, Cambridge will change its name and its
primary area of business activity.

As from today, again with your approval, the Company will no longer
be focused on the search for diamonds, but on the international scene
of fibre optics and telecommunications. No longer will the Company be
known as Cambridge Gulf or Cambridge Consolidated, but as Cable 
&

Telecoms Limited.

Today the Company will start life anew and the characters and the
notoriety of the past will become exactly that - remembered only as
part of a colourful chapter of Australian public company folklore.

So we move on - to the world of communications - not only for today
but also for tomorrow. There is little doubt that the world is
experiencing vast change - revolutionary change. A change more
dramatic and probably more impacting than the change and the
consequences of the Industrial Revolution. The pace of change will
continue to quicken, it will not slow down.

As this happens, the necessity to provide the technology capable of
delivering it will grow enormously. We have seen specific and
dramatic evidence of the commercial expectations within the
telecommunications industry in recent months.

We have witnessed the worldwide explosion of bid prices for
generation 3 mobile spectrum. In Europe those bids approached 50
billion pounds while in Australia they are expected to bring about \$6
billion. Those bids are founded on the belief that the
telecommunications customer will require, indeed will demand, more
than just voice but data, lots and lots of data. They will seek data
in all its various forms from video to internet, email, TV signals
and more.

Coming to this conclusion is easy. Providing the solution, however,
is a different story. People don
'
t just want data they want it
quickly. They do not want to sit in front of a computer and watch it
click, line by line into action. This is not the fault of the
computer or the software but in the lines that carry it. In layman
'
s
terms, the pipes carrying the data are simply too small - too skinny.
We need large capacity/high delivery cables and we need fibre optics.
No longer the speed of sound but the speed of light. No longer copper
but glass.

This is where Cable 
&
 Telecoms, or CaT as we affectionately refer to
it as, steps into the arena. CaT is a subsidiary of the UDC Group Pty
Ltd which is to be acquired by the Company.

Cable 
&
 Telecoms is one of a select group to hold an unrestricted
carriers licence under the Australian Telecommunications Act. As you
have been advised, CaT is planning a national fibre optic strategy
with an initial project from Busselton to Joondalup.

Does CaT have the skill base to achieve this objective? The Directors
believe the answer is clearly, yes. The Company
'
s wholly owned
subsidiary, Commcord Communications is one of the more experienced
cable design, engineering and construction companies in Australia,
with a client list of blue chip customers. Within the Company lies
the expertise to fulfill its undertakings.

CaT will continue its rollout to commercially targeted and sales
orientated markets Australia-wide. The Company will be consumer led,
ie the rollout will follow a path determined by the sales team rather
than the other way around. In simple terms, that means the cable will
be laid in areas chosen for their high sales potential instead of a

"
hit and hope
"
 strategy.

Complementing this initiative is CaT
'
s sales team. The sales team
brings to the Company substantial experience in the fields of sales
management and marketing, specifically in the telecommunications
industry.

CaT is not and does not intend to be solely a cable laying company or
select network owner - nor does it intend to be simply a conveyancer
of telephony product. CaT
'
s vision is to be a next generation
communications provider delivering convergent technology and content
to residential and commercial customers in metropolitan and regional
Australia.

Its primary focus will be Interactive Entertainment and Innovative
Virtual Training and Education, Full Service Telecommunication
provision and the development and utilisation of its own strategic
fibre optic network.

In the initial and intermediate phases, the Company will piggyback
other network infrastructures as well as utilising alternate
broadband delivery technologies to reach its target market. Over time
the Company will divert to its own network.

In the interactive entertainment arena, CaT is developing with its
alliance partners, an interactive entertainment and e-commerce system
to bundle with telecommunications services that can be directed to
either the television set or personal computer.

This will include: 
* 
"
Real time
"
 video on demand including access to major film titles;
  science, travel and lifestyle documentaries; sports, educational
  recreational videos; and local content programs
* Online music via live venues, recording studio and video streaming
* High speed internet access 
* Interactive shopping 
* Home banking

Further information on the strategic alliance partners and the
implementation plans will be provided as circumstances allow.

CaT is also at the leading edge in the use of telecommunications
carriage for education information, interactive instruction and
training. You may have read of CaT
'
s involvement in a unique state of
the art telemedicine facility, located at the University of Western
Australia. This major new facility brings together renowned medical
establishments such as the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and
the Australian Society of Anaesthetists and others. Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth very recently officially opened that facility.

Ladies and gentlemen, it would be easy to go on, however, I know many
of you have other pressing needs this morning. I will, together with
directors of the Company be available at the conclusion of the
meeting to provide further general details in response to specific
questions which individual shareholders may have.

I would now like to call upon Andrew Waller to address the meeting to
provide further background on the UDC Group

IPO PROPOSED FOR NEW CARDIA ACQUISITION

Cardia Technologies Limited (ASX:CNN) today announced the acquisition
of a controlling share in leading biotechnology company, BIOGLOBAL.

Bioglobal specialises in the extraction of active ingredients from
natural plant material for pharmaceutical and agricultural products.
It is also starting to generate cashflow from agricultural
technologies to manage broad scale pests in key crops.

Cardia will issue 3 million shares at 15c with a free attaching
option (exp 21.12.2004) to Bioglobal shareholders in return for which
Bioglobal will issue 22 million shares to Cardia (being 51 percent of
the issued capital of Bioglobal).

Cardia Chairman, Mr. Pat Volpe said, 
"
Chemicals are damaging the
environment - of that there is no doubt. Cardia is committed to
expanding its stable of environmentally sound companies that are
finding alternative, natural methods to traditional problems. In that
respect, Bioglobal is a perfect fit.
"


Initially, Bioglobal will raise \$430,000 working capital in a 1 for
10 rights issue at 10c per share. This will result in 4,300,000 new
shares being issued in Bioglobal if fully subscribed of which Cardia
will be entitled to 2.193 million.


"
Coupled with this is the opportunity to assist with the public
listing of Bioglobal, delivering to Cardia shareholders a diversified
investment portfolio, and the opportunity to enter a dynamic company
like Bioglobal at the ground level.
"


The IPO is planned to raise a minimum of \$4 million for additional
working capital and investment opportunities. Existing Cardia
shareholders will receive priority on 70 percent, with the remaining
30 percent being placed at the discretion of the vendors.

DIVERSIFIED UNITED INVESTMENT LIMITED

The Directors advise that the unaudited net asset backing of the
company
'
s ordinary shares at 31 January 2000 was \$1.87 (31 December
1999: \$2.03). The net asset backing calculation is based on
investments at market value, is after provision for tax on net
realised gains and before tax on unrealised gains and is before
provision for an interim dividend.

Diversified United Investment Limited is a long term investor and
does not intend disposing of its total portfolio. If estimated tax on
unrealised portfolio gains were to he deducted the above asset
backing figure would be \$1.63 (31 December 1999: \$1.74).

REQUEST FOR TRADING HALT

In accordance with Listing Rule 17.1, eBet seeks a trading halt.

eBet seeks a trading halt on the basis that it proposes to issue an
announcement within the next 12 - 24 hours in relation to its entry
into a material transaction relating to its eBet Online business.

eBet is concerned that speculation regarding possible transactions is
impacting on the price at which eBet shares are currently traded on
ASX. The grant of a trading halt will ensure that trading may be
undertaken in an informed environment.

eBet seeks a trading halt until release of its ASX announcement in
relation to this transaction. It expects that the announcement will
be released before commencement of trading on Thursday 9 March 2000
and in any event by no later than 2pm.

eBet is not aware of any reason why the trading halt should not be
granted. 

Please give me a call if you have any questions in relation to the 
above.

EGERTON CORPORATION LIMITED

CHAIRMAN
'
S LETTER

This Company was listed in April 1994 and until recently its
Directors were committed to active exploration in an attempt to add
value for shareholders.

At the beginning of last calendar year the Directors adopted a
strategy to:

* continue with active exploration through to June 1999, after which
operations were to be scaled back it there had been no exploration
success;

* divest the Company of its interests in Queensland and determine
what ongoing strategy is appropriate for the Company
'
s interests in
the Philippines; and

* look for other investments which may add value for shareholders.

The outcome of this strategy resulted in this Company:

* farming out its major Western Australian project, selling its
Queensland project and withdrawing from all activity in the
Philippines; and

* identifying and then making an investment in an opportunity which
the Directors believed could add value for shareholders.

On 29 September 1999 this Company announced its proposal to make an
investment into MemberCorp and to sell its remaining interest in its
Queensland project. This saw the price of the Company
'
s shares
increase to a high of 11 cents per share (on 29 September 1999) and
the Company was able to raise \$3,200,000 to fund the exercise of the
option to subscribe for a fully diluted 20% of MemberCorp.

Subsequently, on 15 December 1999 the Company announced its proposal
to purchase all of the issued capital of Equico from the Equico
Shareholders, which acquisition will result in the Company:

* acquiring a profitable financial services and leasing business; and

* increasing its relevant interest in MemberCorp to a fully diluted
39.5%, which when combined with the relevant interest of its
associates gives the Company an entitlement to fully diluted 72.9%
interest.

Approval for the transaction and other associated matters is being
sought from shareholders at a meeting called for 9 March 2000.

This Prospectus is being issued to enable this Company to raise up to
\$5,000,000 to be used to fund the payment of the cash component of
the Equico purchase price and to provide this Company with working
capital and other for matters. The Offer is subject to shareholders
approving the resolutions at the general meeting of the Company to be
held on 9 March 2000, and to settlement occurring under the Share
Sale Agreement.

I look forward to your support for this issue.

Please find following amendment to and replacement of an announcement 
made by Empire Oil 
&
 Gas NL on Monday 14 February 2000.

J L Craig Marshall
MANAGING DIRECTOR

REVISED ANNOUNCEMENT
ONSHORE SOUTHERN CARNARVON BASIN EXPLORATION POSITION

Empire Oil 
&
 Gas NL, holder of 100% of Carnarvon Basin permit EP 405,
announce that, subject to the completion of relevant documentation,
it has reached an agreement with the title holders of the contiguous
permits EP369 and EP410 for an equity swap which will give all
parties equal equities in all three permits. 

This Agreement generates a combined exploration area in excess of
12,865 sqkm or 3.2 million acres, which contains three seismically
mapped exploration prospects having combined potential recoverable
reserves of 11.6 million barrels oil and 504 BCF gas.

The enlarged exploration area covers the most prospective portions of
the under explored southern onshore Carnarvon/Merlinleigh Sub-basin,
which contains major Devonian reef and Permian age clastic play
types. The 1960
'
s WAPET Kennedy Range 1 well which encountered sub
commercial gas shows while drilling, confirmed the area could host
commercial petroleum reserves.

The Joint Venture parties feel that, with the demonstrated range of
exploration plays, access to the whole sub-basin, and close proximity
to pipeline infrastructure, major highways and regional centres, this
exploration area will be of interest to an incoming exploration
investor, especially a North American exploration group skilled in
these play types.

Equity holders in the joint venture are:

Empire Oil Company (WA) Ltd           33.33%
Euro Pacific Energy Pty Ltd           31.67%
Gulliver Productions Pty Ltd          11.11%
Falcore Ply Ltd                       11.11%
Indigo Oil Pty Ltd                    11.11%
Vigilant Oil Pty Ltd                   1.67%

ELECTROMETALS TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED
Brisbane
In the past few days, there has been considerable interest shown by 
the share market in companies engaged in developing technologies to 
clean up water contaminated by previous mining activities. In this 
announcement we would like to clarify the nature and role of our 
patented EMEW technology in relation to those other technologies.

Remediation of contaminated mine runoff water is an important market 
for Electrometals, although it is only one of a number of very 
promising applications for our unique electrowinning technology.

As was mentioned in an announcement made by Geo2 Limited yesterday, 
we have installed several pilot plants to remove the copper from 
acid mine drainage streams at Freeport Indonesia
'
s giant Grasberg 
copper/gold mine in Irian Jaya. Our equipment has now been proven to 
be effective in removing the copper down to targeted levels while at 
the same time producing high quality saleable copper metal. 
Moreover, it would appear that this can be done at operating costs 
significantly below the value of the meal produced. Our EMEW 
technology therefore stands out as a uniquely valuable technique for 
not only extracting toxic metals from minesite runoff, but also 
making the clean-up pay its way. We are unaware of any other 
technology that can achieve those combined benefits.

We wish to emphasise that the EMEW technology is now a developed, 
successful product currently being employed by users in a range of 
businesses, not just mine remediation. For example, we have supplied 
a plant to recover high grade nickel from refinery wastes at Encycle 
Inc.
'
s waste recycling facility in Texas, USA, and we have been 
advised that the EMEW plant is not only working well, but is about 
to be significantly expanded. Again, we have supplied a small EMEW 
plant for the recovery of copper from industrial acid wash baths 
used by a Brisbane metal manufacturer, and this has also been so 
successful that a second EMEW plant is being considered. Our 
technology has been tested in the recovery of silver from tailings 
produced at BHP
'
s Cannington lead zinc mine in central Queensland, 
and a pilot plant has now been ordered by BHP. Another EMEW plant we 
are about to ship will strip copper and lead from a metal recycling 
operation in Tasmania.

In summary, our patented and proven EMEW electrowinning technology 
offers a highly efficient means of extracting a wide range of 
dissolved metals from low grade solutions. This can be performed 
profitably in conjunction with precipitation and neutralisation of 
contaminants by many of the mine remediation techniques being 
pursued and promoted by companies which are currently the focus of 
market attention. Our technology should be viewed as complementary 
to those processes, permitting economically attractive conversion of 
toxic metal precipitates into saleable metal. However, our business 
goes well beyond mine remediation, and covers a vast range of 
potential applications in industrial processes, mineral processing, 
and environmental rehabilitation.

We welcome the recent heightened interest in mine remediation 
techniques, and the enormous market potential presented by 
contaminated minesites around the world. We wish the market to 
understand that our technology enjoys not only a unique position in 
relation to that market, but also serves a much wider and equally 
exciting market for extraction of metals in other settings.

We advise that Deutsche Bank intends to adjust the Underlying Parcel
for this series to become:

3 shares in ERG Limited (
"
ERG
"
)

The Required Number of Warrants remains at 4.

WHY WILL THIS ADJUSTMENT BE NECESSARY?

ERG gained Shareholder approval on 27 October 2000 to convert all of
its shares into a larger number, by converting each fully paid
ordinary share issued as at 8 November 2000 into three fully paid
ordinary shares. The conversion will take affect on 8 November 2000.

HOW WILL THE ADJUSTMENT BE MADE?

Deutsche Bank will adjust the Underlying Security in ERGWDB from one
ERG Limited share to three ERG Limited shares, while making no change
to the number of warrants holders currently hold, the exercise price
or the Required Number of Warrants. The terms of this adjustment are
consistent with section 3.12 the Offering Circular dated 12 May 2000
under which ERGWDB was issued (Section 3.12 deals with
reconstructions of capital in the Underlying Security).

The Underlying Security will be adjusted in accordance with the
shareholders resolution effective 8 November 2000. The warrant will
trade on a reconstructured basis as of 1 November 2000 which is
consistent with the commencement of the trading in the Underlying
Security.

Any queries regarding the adjustment should be directed to Ben Smoker
(tel: 1300 656 287).

Murdoch Researcher Isolates MS Virus

EXODUS MINERALS LIMITED
Perth
PRESS RELEASE

After more than 30 years of research, Murdoch University Associate
Professor Bob Cook has isolated a virus which could cause multiple
sclerosis (MS).

He has also attracted commercial investment in his research from
Perth-based Exodus Minerals, through its life sciences subsidiary
InQbate, which could result in the creation of a diagnostic tool for
MS.

MS is a chronic disease affecting about 12,000 Australians and around
two million people worldwide.

MS sufferers show similar signs to the physical effects of
drunkenness including blurred vision, in-coordination and slurred
speech.

According to Professor Cook, of Murdoch
'
s Division of Veterinary and
Biomedical Sciences, more emphasis has been placed on viral causes
of the disease in recent years.


"
Other researchers are looking at herpes-type viruses and
retroviruses (like AIDS) but so far results have been inconclusive,
"

he said.


"
Our research has been slightly different. We are examining
recognized common features found in the damaged area of MS brains,
and have found that they are viral proteins rather than just myelin
debris.


"
This has led to the consistent isolation of a previously unknown
virus from MS brain tissue.

Professor Cook said it took some time to find ways to grow the virus
rapidly, but it could now be grown in nine to 10 days instead of
seven weeks, thus facilitating research.

Though still early days, Professor Cook said experiments indicated
the virus was closely related to measles.


"
We now need to complete the genetic sequence of the virus so we can
use a small part as a substrate in a commercial test kit,
"
 he said.


"
In the long term we are hoping to develop a specific treatment for
MS, and eventually, a vaccine.
"


The intellectual property generated by Professor Cook
'
s research is
owned by MS Biotechnology.

Exodus Minerals, through InQbate, has now reached an agreement to
help fund Professor Cook
'
s further research by purchasing a 15%
interest in MS Biotechnology. This agreement was announced to the
Australian Stock Exchange on 23 October.

Exodus Minerals may also acquire a further 25% interest in MS
Biotechnology if the research project meets its major milestones.

FIRST AUSTRALIAN RESOURCES LIMITED
Perth
CLEAR BRANCH FIELD, JACKSON PARISH, NORTH LOUISIANA

A completion rig is due on location Wednesday to perforate and test
each of the Green, Orange, Yellow and Blue Hosston Sands in the Terry
Ewing No 1 wellbore. The final production configuration from these
Sands will depend upon testing. Each of these Sands appears
productive on well logs and the Blue and Yellow Sands have been
prolific producers in the Field.

A completion in the Hosston Sands presents an attractive near term
option; enabling gas sales to proceed in the prevailing gas market,
while more detailed studies are conducted on the anomalous behaviour
of the deeper Cotton Valley at this location.

Construction of a flow line connecting with the Louisiana State Gas
Pipeline is complete enabling gas to be sold from the Hosston Sands.

The Terry Ewing No 1 well lies on trend with significant Hosston and
Cotton Valley production which blankets a portion of North Louisiana.
Hunt Oil discovered the field in 1976 and has produced in excess of
55 billion cubic feet of gas from multiple Hosston reservoirs.

Importantly, all of the gas completions within the field were natural
and no infill drilling or stimulation has been applied at Clear
Branch. Engineering studies suggest significant amounts of producible
gas could remain within the Hosston reservoirs (between 9,000 and
10,300 feet) and be recovered by wells drilled on smaller spacing.

The joint venture has contracted a second well, the Willamette No 2,
a test of the Blue and Yellow Hosston Sands at a location
approximately 2,400 feet to the north of the No 1 well. A rig is
scheduled to arrive during November. 

FAR has a 12.5 percent participation in the Clear Branch project
reducing to a 9.375% working interest on completion of the test well.
Other interests are held by North American companies including the
operator, Rio Bravo Exploration 
&
 Production Company.

Foster
'
s Brewing Group (Foster
'
s) has recorded bumper sales for
December from both its beer and wine divisions.

Commenting on the success of the holiday season, Foster
'
s President
and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ted Kunkel, said that the strong beer
and wine sales for the period confirmed Foster
'
s was on track to
record a solid performance for the first half of the financial year.

Foster
'
s Australian beer division, Carlton and United Breweries
(CUB), has reported an increase in sales of its flagship premium
beer, Crown Lager, of nearly 30% (148,468 cases) for December,
compared to the same period last year.

Sales of Crown Lager were eight times higher than its nearest rival
in the premium beer category, confirming the brands position as
Australia
'
s leading premium lager, with a 25% share of the segment.

Other highlights for the Millennium period saw:

* Crown Lager record its largest monthly sales ever 
* Cascade Premium Lager achieve a 12% increase in sales for the
  December period. 
* Sales of Carlton Midstrength Bitter increase by 78% compared to the
  same period last year
* Sales of Carlton Cold rose by nearly 6% for December.
* Victoria Bitter (VB) maintain its firmly entrenched position as the
  number one selling full strength beer in Australia, with one in 
  every four beers sold a VB. 
* Foster
'
s Light1ce maintain its position as Australia
'
s number one
  selling light strength beer during the period.

Reflecting on CUB
'
s success, Mr Kunkel said, 
"
CUB has once again
shown that it is, without a shadow of doubt, Australia
'
s leading
brewer, producing the beer brands Australian consumers choose to
drink,
"


Foster
'
s wine division, Mildara Blass, has also enjoyed a surge in
sales in the lead up to Millennium celebrations. During the December
period:

* 232,900 cases of the Yellowglen sparkling wine range were sold,
  representing a 68% increase on the same period last year. 
* Across all Mildara Blass
'
 retail sparkling wine brands, sales
  increased by 60%.
* Cellarmasters saw strong domestic sales volumes with 61,548 cases
  sold in December an increase of 11% against the same month last 
  year.
* Domestic and global wine brands continued their growth trajectory.


"
Mildara Blass has enjoyed strong sales for the Christmas, New Year
period. The results speak for themselves, we are very pleased with
the performance,
"
 Mr Kunkel said.

e-mail: john.robertson@fosters.com.au

Let me add my welcome to that of the Chairman and thank you very much
for joining us today.

I intend to spend most of the time talking about our business
strategies and, in that context, about: 

* premium brands; 

* how we are building a manufacturing company for the new millennium;
and,

* the pursuit of higher returns for our shareholders.

But before talking about these strategic issues, I do want to briefly
comment on the recent financial performance.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

In the last month, the company released its profit results for the
six months to December so it is timely to quickly review them for
you.

The directors and management were very happy with the result. It met
the financial goals which had been set for the group and allowed an
increase of 18% in the interim dividend which rose to 6.5 cents a
share. That increase followed the 25% increase in the final dividend
last October. And, of course, the dividend is fully franked.

In the half: 

* net profit grew by 27% to \$243 million; 

* earnings per share also rose by 27% to 14.1 cents a share; 

* profit from beer grew by 15%: 

* driven by the many exciting developments overseas, the wine
group profit was 34% higher; and, 

* our rapidly expanding leisure and hospitality business showed a 61%
increase in profitability.

There were some accounting standard changes which had a positive
impact and profit growth was helped by the effect of acquisitions
within the wine and leisure arms so I would caution against literally
extrapolating such strong rates of growth into the future.

Nonetheless, putting those effects aside, the pace of the underlying
profit expansion was very much in line with what had been targeted.
So, overall, I am happy to report that the group was travelling well
in the first half.

The result for the full year will depend on overall business
conditions which may not be as supportive as they have been. 

* Interest rates have begun to rise. 

* Petrol prices are pushing toward recent record levels. 

* There is some uncertainty associated with the upcoming tax changes.

Whether any of these things eventually has an effect on the business,
only time will tell but they are issues which will be relevant to all
businesses in the coming months.

At this point, there has been nothing in the business environment to
change our view about the likely overall outcome for the year.

Whatever the business conditions, however, strategic positioning, as
always, will determine who fares best.

BUSINESS STRATEGY: CREATING A MULTI-PRODUCT OFFERING 

For Foster
'
s, the financial outcome for the half - and,
prospectively, for the full year - reflected many of the decisions
taken in recent years to restructure the company and develop a
multi-product offering for its customers.

This was a quite deliberate strategy which: 

* anticipated the difficulty of sustaining historical rates of profit
growth from beer; and,

* recognised, at the same time, that there were opportunities - by
using our existing skills - to sustain targeted rates of growth by
changing the business mix.

We had prided ourselves on sustaining a double digit rate of profit
growth. That remains an achievable objective for the group as a whole
but, going forward, the business mix to achieve that will be
different.

The chart you are now viewing illustrates the extent of the change
which has already occurred. Today, slightly less than half the
revenue is being generated from beer. The leisure and hospitality and
wine arms, together, are equivalent in size to beer.

This change has been made in the name of becoming a more competitive
investment. What does that mean?

We look at it in terms of rates of return.

The first question we ask is: are we adding value to the funds
employed in the business?

We have \$3.4 billion in funds employed - about \$2.4 billion of equity
and one billion of debt. Based on the current cost of debt and
equity, Foster
'
s should be generating a 9% rate of return after tax
to justify holding those funds.

In the last financial year, Foster
'
s achieved a rate of return of
11.2% and in the 12 months to December 1999 increased that further to
12.8%. And, all going well, the rate of return should increase again
for the full 1999/2000 financial year.

So, we are clearing the hurdle and adding value on a consistent
basis, something which has been the culmination of many years of hard
work. But it was a goal worth pursuing because, once achieved, 

* value could be added to your shareholding in the company; and,

* there would be greater strategic flexibility - because it did not
make sense to expand the asset base until the rate of return was
first pushed to higher levels.

But that isn
'
t enough in judging whether we are competitive. The
second question we need to ask is: are we doing better than other
companies?

There is no single measure which provides the answer. But here, too,
rates of return are relevant. In the year to June 1999, our rate of
return was better than the average of the Australian manufacturing
companies against which we can compare Foster
'
s by almost 3.5
percentage points.

And, we would be aiming to extend that lead again this year. So, the
company is establishing itself as a competitive investment
alternative. Over time, that should be the basis for above average
share price performance.

As of yesterday, the Foster
'
s share price was slightly ahead of where
it was at the end of June 1999 which, so far this financial year,
puts it in the top 35 performing stocks among the one hundred largest
companies in the market 
   - better than most but not as good as we would like to see.

And, by 
'
we
'
, I mean Foster
'
s employees generally because more than
80% of eligible employees participate in the employee share ownership
scheme and share with you a keen interest in the Foster
'
s share price
performance. 

But the share price performance has probably been affected by the
recent fixation with technology and media stocks which have been the
outstanding market performers and which head the table.

Over the longer time frame shown in this chart, however, the Foster
'
s
share price has risen faster than the All Industrials Index and, for
a so-called 
'
old style
'
 manufacturing business, has done relatively
well.

Looking ahead, Foster
'
s will continue its highly focussed approach to
building value because history shows that the incremental value
created in that way will be reflected in the share price over time.

The primary aim will be to establish and manage businesses with a
rate of return above the group
'
s cost of capital - businesses which
will, ideally, also have a superior growth profile. 

Being realistic, however, that might not always be possible and, at
times, a lower than average return business might have to be accepted
temporarily provided that it has better than average growth
prospects; in other words, a company in the upper left quadrant of
the diagram you can now see.

Equally, there might be times when a below average growth
business is not only acceptable but highly desirable if it has a
markedly superior return. Such a business might fall in the lower
right.

But a business which fell into the lower left quadrant would have to
be earmarked for sale if it could not somehow be changed.

Foster
'
s, today, reflects these choices. The low return, low growth
businesses have been sold. The strength of the new combination is
that it is a balanced mix of high return businesses and future
growth. 

* There is the already high return Australian beer business currently
with a return double its cost of capital.

* Our beer businesses in the UK and the USA are growing strongly and
have returns well in excess of their cost of capital.

* The wine business is growing strongly, too. The return is lower
than our targets but it is rising and should reach our targeted
levels in the foreseeable future.

* There are longer-term developmental opportunities such as the
Fosters brand in Asia and South America with strong short-term
growth.

* Then there are the bolt-on businesses which use the existing skill
and asset base in Australia to greater effect. The best example of
that is the leisure group.

* Similarly, we have initiated an investment in spirits manufacture
and distribution.

Foster
'
s has the best distribution system in Australia for alcohol
products. In the past, that has been used for beer. Today, it can the
used for beer, wine and spirits.

The investment in spirits will also allow us to develop new mixed
drinks which are such a popular part of the Australian beverage
market.

It is this combination which will distinguish Foster
'
s from other
companies and make it a unique opportunity for investors.

Others will attempt to duplicate the portfolio of products because
many of our customers are saying that they want the convenience of a
total service provider - someone who can sell beer, wine and spirits
with one invoice and payments system.

And that illustrates the potential synergies going forward. Foster
'
s
will be able to do that with one set of overheads not three. There
will be opportunities to bring the various parts of the business
together to enhance the service customers receive and to provide a
lower cost base for the business as a whole

FOREST ENTERPRISES AUSTRALIA LIMITED
Melbourne
Premier hardwood plantation manager, Forest Enterprises Australia
Limited (FEA) today announced its results for the year ended 30th
June 2000.

FEA
'
s operating profit before tax for the year is \$21.5 million,
which is 459% higher than the previous financial year. The Directors
were overwhelmed by Grower interest in the woodlot projects and were
forced to close in March due to over-subscriptions comfortably
achieving IPO forecasts.

The increase in net profit is the combined result of strong support
for FEA
'
s hardwood plantation projects via prospectus sales and its
vertical integration business model 
'
from seedling to sales
'
 which
allows it to minimize and control costs. FEA surpassed prospectus
forecasts by approximately 30% for Woodlot sales, exceeding 9,100
hectares for the year-ended June 30, compared to a forecast of 7,040
hectares. Total revenues increased by 361% for the year to \$47.4
million.

FEA plans to release its 
'
Australian Forests Project 2001
'
 prospectus
in October. It is proposed that the Project will feature an
attractive investment option for Growers seeking a 100% tax-deduction
with lease and management fees deferred and offset against harvest
proceeds at a later date. FEA
'
s network of accountants and financial
planners have already indicated a strong desire to support the new
investment option.

As one of Australia
'
s most successful timber plantation managers the
Group has plans to plant over 5,000 hectares in Northern New South
Wales and Southern Queensland for the 2001 project and will use its
expertise to diversify its operations nationally. This is in addition
to the planned 7,000ha to be planted in Tasmania during the
forthcoming year.

The Board of Directors are confident that FEA
'
s strong track record,
clear and coherent business model and diversified revenue streams
will outperform in the long term.

GOODMAN HARDIE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY TRUST
Sydney
Following discussions with the Australian Securities 
&
 Investments
Commission (ASIC), Goodman Hardie Management Australia Limited
(GHMAL), the Responsible Entity for Goodman Hardie Industrial
Property Trust (ARSN 091 213 839), wishes to clarify the manner in
which its takeover offer for the Flinders Industrial Property Trust
(Flinders) is regulated. 

GHMAL
'
s offer is not regulated by Chapter 6 of the Corporations Law,
as Chapter 6 only extends to registered listed managed investment
schemes. At present Flinders is not registered. However, the trust
deed constituting Flinders requires any take-over offer made to
Flinders
'
 Unitholders to be on the same terms as if Chapter 6 of the
Corporations Law applied to that take-over offer.

The only substantial difference for Flinders
'
 Unitholders is that
ASIC
'
s role as regulator is instead undertaken by the manager and
trustee of Flinders, being Australia Asia Investment Management
Limited and Trust Company of Australia Limited respectively. The
proposed offer for Flinders by Stockland Trust Group will be
regulated in the same way.

Any future communications with Flinders
'
 Unitholders will include
this clarification.

AWE
"
) exploration wells in Argentina and New Zealand.

ARGENTINA

In Argentina, AWE
'
s wholly owned subsidiary AWE Argentina Pty
Limited, advises the Ramblon Verde-1 well in CNQ-16/A has been cased
and suspended awaiting future production testing (see attached map
for location).

Oil and gas shows were encountered over the gross interval from
1445-1525m. Cores were taken over the intervals from 1472-1481m and
1525m-1542m.

Wireline logging has identified thin potential oil-bearing intervals
that will be tested when a workover rig moves to the drilling site in
an estimated two weeks time. The commercial significance of these
intervals cannot be determined until at least the completion of
production testing.

AWE also advises that the rig has moved to the Puesto Lujan-l
exploration well site.

Interest holders in the CNQ-16/A Block are: 

AWE Argentina Pty Limited                           15% 
Chevron San Jorge SA (operator)                     60% 
Fletcher Challenge Energy Argentina Limited         25%

Recording of the 250 square kilometre 3D seismic survey over the
north-eastern sector of CNQ-16/A also progressed satisfactorily
during the week. Approximately 101 sqkm have now been recorded.

NEW ZEALAND

In New Zealand, AWE
'
s wholly owned subsidiary, AWE New Zealand Pty
Limited, advises that as at 0600 hours on February 22 the
Hochstetter-1 well in PEP 38460 had reached a depth of 2860 metres.
Intermediate logs have been recorded and casing is being run, prior
to drilling ahead into the primary objective zones (see attached map
for location).

CHAIRMAN
'
S REPORT

On behalf of the Board, management and staff of Finemores, I am
pleased to provide my report as an introduction to the 1999/2000
Concise Report for Finemore Holdings Limited.

THE 1999/2000 YEAR

The transport industry generally has struggled under increased
pressure in the last 12 months with the Implementation costs of Y2K,
GST compliance and skyrocketing fuel costs. Whilst the implementation
of the Federal Government
'
s Diesel Fuel Rebate has been a welcome
relief, the cost Imposts on the transport Industry are such that we
have seen margins squeezed and a number of smaller operators go out
of business. This has lead to Industry unrest and driver protests
lobbying for rate increases. These issues have combined to make life
in this industry the most difficult I have encountered in my 34 years
in the industry.

The outlook for the year ahead will continue to be characterised by
rising fuel costs and interest rates, the falling value of the local
currency and therefore increased costs of imported equipment.

The tough Industry conditions have been reflected in the Company
'
s
disappointing trading results for the year, which are explained in
mars detail in the Review of Operations section of the Directors
'

Report on page 6 of the Concise Report.

Despite the Company
'
s disappointing results and the tough Industry
conditions we have been working hard within the operating divisions
doing as much as possible to add maximum value for shareholders.

The Distribution Services Division and Liquids Division have been
revitalised with the appointment of new General Managers, who have
implemented cultural and systemic change throughout these divisions
with positive results.

Finemores have successfully secured significant new business
including the distribution of dry grocery products for Woolworths
Limited in NSW, cartage and warehousing services for Carter Holt
Harvey Pulp 
&
 Paper and a new contract with Esso Thailand for the
delivery of fuel oil throughout Bangkok. Finemores have also further
expanded our presence in South East Asia with the formation of a
joint venture logistics business in China transporting coal for the
regional power authority. This business has the potential to expand
and service other industries and regions within China.

One of the highlights of the year was receipt of the General Motors
International Supplier of the Year Award for logistics. This award
was received for the third successive year, which is a great
achievement and everyone connected with this business should be
congratulated on maintaining our high level of service.

THE COMPANY
'
S FUTURE

During the last twelve months we have evaluated where we are in the
marketplace and reviewed where we could go in the future. We have
also had to take into consideration the ongoing consolidation of the
Industry.

We looked at how we could build on what we already had in Finemores,
in various ways, to both add value for the existing shareholders and
to be a player in the future. During this process we received an
offer from Toll Holdings to take over the Company, and subsequently
negotiated a price of \$2.25 per share. Your directors felt that this
offer represented a fair value for the business, given the market
place that existed at that time. This was acknowledged by 75% of
shareholders in number, accounting for over 68% of the shares of the
Company, accepting the \$2.25 per share offered by Toll Holdings.

As you would now be aware, this bid lapsed because Toll failed to
achieve the 90% minimum acceptance condition in their bid offer.

Subsequent to the lapsing of the Toll Bid, the Board continued to
evaluate ways of optimising shareholder value. One option, given the
high level of shareholder acceptances to the Toll offer, was to
explore other ways of merging the company
'
s businesses with those of
Toll. This option was evaluated against the alternative of the
Company continuing as an Independent player in the Industry.

The Board decided that the arguments in favour of continuing as an
Independent player could not outweigh the immediate benefit to
shareholders of a merging of the business with Toll Holdings in
return for similar consideration to that offered under the Toll
takeover offer. This resulted in the company executing a Merger
Implementation Deed with Toll Holdings whereby Finemores agreed to
take certain steps to progress such a merger through either a scheme
of arrangement or sale of the businesses of the company.

We expect that shareholders will receive documentation on those
proposals during the course of December for shareholder meetings
scheduled to take place in late January.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff of
Finemores for their effort and dedication over the past year through
a period of particularly difficult economic trading conditions and
uncertainty. Your support and diligence is greatly appreciated and we
look forward positively to the future.

I would also like to thank those shareholders who have continued to
support us. As you would realise I have personally found the past
twelve months extremely difficult. I have worked all my life building
the Company and to have to recommend the proposed merger has been 
&

very difficult decision. It is however, I believe, in the best
interest of shareholders.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA

COOBER PEDY - WARRINA/MT WOODS PROJECT 

Drilling programmes have been completed at the Cadi project and on
regional targets. A data review has commenced on the Mt Woods area.

Cadi - A further five rotary percussion drill holes totaling 1173m
were completed at Cadi. The width of the mineralised system has been
extended to 600m although it remains open to the east, north and
south. Zones of pyroxene-hornblende-magnetite-pyrrhotite show
anomalous copper and rare earth levels similar to those previously
reported with additional intervals of minor lead-zinc-silver,
molybdenum and cobalt mineralisation. Best assays results include 2m
@ 0.92% Zn, 0.64% Pb, 6.7g/t Ag, 2m @ 0.05% Mo and 6m @ 764ppm Co.

The Cadi magnetic/gravity feature covers an area of approximately 4
square kilometers and various geophysical methods are being employed
in order to localise higher sulphide target zones within this
extensive mineralised system.

Regional - A total of 10 regional gravity and magnetic targets have
been tested by 14 rotary percussion drill holes for 2475m. Six of the
targets returned indications of alteration or mineralisation, which
included disseminated sulphide, hematite, silica, chlorite and skarn.
Best result was Hole WS006 at target CP-1 which intersected 16m @
0.15% Cu from a depth of 140m. These newly discovered alteration
systems highlight the regional prospectivity of the Warrina tenements
and each system will be further assessed pending the results of the
geophysical testing at Cadi.

Mt Woods - A review of previous investigations at Mt Woods shows that
significant mineralisation has been intersected particularly at the
Cairn Hill Prospect. Data is still being analysed before field
operations are undertaken, Prior intersections include;

12m @ 1.6% Cu, 0.6g/t Au 
 9m @ 0.95% Cu, 1.02g/t Au.

MT PAINTER (GDM 75%. Bonanza 25%)

No fieldwork was undertaken at Mt Gee or on other Mt Painter projects
during the period.

CORINNA JOINT VENTURE 

No fieldwork was undertaken during the period.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA

GILES COMPLEX

Goldstream has extended its tenement holding in the Western Musgrave
to 14 exploration Licences covering approximately 2250 square
kilometers. The principle target is for massive sulphide Ni-Cu
mineralisation associated with feeder conduits to the various Giles
Complex layered mafic intrusives. The tenements cover a number of
aeromagnetic features located within regionally significant
magnetic/gravity structures that separate and disrupt the larger
intrusive bodies. This geological setting is analogous to that
hosting the huge Voiseys Bay Ni-Cu deposits in Canada.

Upon granting and completion of access agreements it is planned to
fly airborne EM surveys over selected magnetic targets to identify
conductors for drill testing.

LEONORA AND LAVERTON AREAS

No fieldwork was undertaken during the period.

DINGO WELL JOINT VENTURE, LEONORA

No work is being conducted on this tenement pending the outcome of
Native Title issues.

BAHEMBA PROJECT

Discussions with potential joint venture partners are ongoing.

MIBANGO PLATINUM PROJECT

Interest in the project has been expressed by several major platinum
and nickel producers and preliminary discussions are being held with
a view to assessing the merits of joint venture participation.
Further review of the historical data-base indicates anomalous
platinum and copper from within the outcropping upper anorthosite
section at Kapalagulu. This mineralisation is at a higher position
within the intrusive compared to the Mitiango ultramafic related
platinum and suggests multiple platinum horizons within the complex.
Rivers in the region are already flowing and field operations have
been delayed until April 2001 following the end of the wet season.

LUWUMBU PLATINUM PROJECT

Field reconnaissance of the historic platinum, chrome, nickel, copper
and iron occurrences has commenced.

Production for the June quarter was 177,252 ounces (net of the Henty
10% gross metal royalty delivered at an average cash cost of \$288/oz.
Total costs were \$414/oz.

All sites operated to full capacity during the quarter. Porgera
delivered another excellent quarter with production in excess of
200,000 ounces (100% basis). Kundana performed extremely well,
returning a record quarterly gold production of 34,852 oz, which
contributed to record annual production of 114,333 oz at lower
operating costs. Paddington operation was devoted entirely to the
treatment of Paddington ore. Henty again achieved record throughput
during the quarter, equivalent to nearly 196,500 tonnes annually.

GRAINCORP LIMITED
Sydney
GrainCorp has released its first winter crop forecast for the year,
predicting 7.4 million tonnes of grain will be delivered into its
storage system this harvest, on the back of generally favorable
growing conditions across NSW for the season so far.

If realised, the 2000/01 harvest will be GrainCorp
'
s fourth largest
on record, closely following last year
'
s record 7.7 m/t winter crop
receival and surpassing the 1998/99 season
'
s 5.8 m/t receival.


"
This above average forecast reflects the excellent seasonal
conditions which have prevailed across NSW so far, with the exception
of isolated pockets that remain dry around Moree and overly wet areas
around Warren and Nyngan,
"
 GrainCorp Chief Operating Officer, Joe Di
Leo, said.


"
In certain areas, reports of increased mice and locust activity are
also being monitored closely. However, given the conditions so far,
all divisions are expected to achieve their forecasts, which will be
revised each month until harvest commences in October,
"
 he said.


"
If achieved, a 7.4 million tonne harvest would see GrainCorp
'
s grain
storage facilities operating at full capacity. GrainCorp is therefore
preparing for the large receival, whilst taking into account the
amount of grain still in storage from last season due to the current
world market outlook,
"
 he said.

Warm weather followed by spring rains are, however, needed over
coming weeks to ensure crops reach their full yield capacity and all
Divisions achieve their forecast receivals.

The positive forecast follows the recent announcement that Victorian
grain growers have given final approval for GrainCorp Ltd and
Vicgrain Ltd to merge businesses.

They also approved a proposal to unite 12,500 NSW and Victorian
growers as members of a new South East Australian grower
organisation, 
"
Grain Growers Association Ltd
"
, which will hold grower
control over the joined agribusiness.

A similar proposal was approved by NSW growers at a meeting of Prime
Wheat Association Ltd members in June. Final approval from the
Supreme Court shortly will see GrainCorp merge with Vicgrain on 3
October, 2000.

As a result of the present political uncertainty and accordingly the
viability of establishing Online Gaming sites in Australia, Gocorp
Limited and Gaming 
&
 Entertainment P/L (GET) by mutual agreement have
terminated their Licence Agreement for utilisation of the GET online
gaming system for the purpose of money play. A Licence has been
granted by GET to Gocorp for a play for points site only. Gocorp have
been appointed as accredited resellers and integrators of the GET
online gaming system.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement between GET and Trans-Global
Interactive Limited (TGL), TGL was entitled to receive 30% of the net
revenue from the Gocorp Licence. TGL
'
s agreement with GET presently
only applies to net revenue associated with internet casinos or
online gambling revenue. The new licence agreed between Gocorp and
GET is only relevant to TGL to the extent that revenue is derived
from internet gambling activities.

Further, and again as a direct consequence of the present political
uncertainty regarding government licencing of online casinos in
Australia, plans for the establishment of the Penthouse Online Casino
have been discontinued and the project terminated.

The proposed Federal Government moratorium has had a general
dampening affect on the emerging online gaming industry and has
caused numerous online gaming projects to be deferred and/or
abandoned.

The Directors accordingly believe that the subject events will have a
significant impact on GET and hence the 30% net revenue entitlement
for TGL.

The GET platform has been designed and developed for multi purpose
applications and consequently the Directors are working closely with
GET to initiate revenue generating projects utilising the GET
platform. The Directors expect to announce a reorganisation Plan in
the near future.

PRESS RELEASE 

CHAIRMAN
'
S STATEMENT

The 1999 net profit of GBP112 million is the highest GPG has ever
produced and, in the circumstances, is unlikely to be repeated in the
foreseeable future.

As already well documented in previous reports, the major component
is the GBP95 million surplus on the sale of Tyndall Australia shares.
Otherwise, the result is satisfactory but not outstanding.
Nevertheless, the 1999 year as a whole was obviously an exceptional
one by any standard of measurement. If the sale of Tyndall shares had
not occurred, it is likely their realisable value would be much less
in today
'
s climate.

Notwithstanding the impression of a very buoyant sharemarket, it is
rather more narrow than generally realised. While the technology and
communications sectors have shown remarkable gains, many traditional
industry leaders have receded in price. Suitable buying opportunities
have therefore been more prolific than originally anticipated with
the consequence that GPG
'
s level of reinvestment has been quite
rapid. The flight of capital into speculative issues has been to
GPG
'
s advantage as a 
"
value investor
"
 but, ironically, has also been
a factor adversely affecting our own share price performance. This
distortion of relative values cannot endure indefinitely.

Balance Sheet stability is the key factor in GPG
'
s value and future
prospects and, in this respect, the position at 31 December 1999 (or
more positively, 1 January 2000) is very reassuring.

                     GBP307m                                 GBP307m

Net assets per share at book value are 60p and at market value of the
portfolio, 66p.

Since balance date, we have received GBP19 million (GBP1.60 per
share) capital return from De Vere Group (formerly The Greenalls
Group).

Staveley has been a poor investment but there are some redeeming
features since last year
'
s bleak scenario. We now hold 29% of the
capital, at an average cost of 80p per share (after writedowns),
which enabled us to obtain Board representation and provide positive
input into maximising the return from Staveley
'
s asset realisation
program. Some recovery in value in the current year can be reasonably
anticipated.

Notwithstanding GPG
'
s successful record and its strong financial
position, it is clear there is some disappointment with the static
share price in recent months. As mentioned earlier, this is partly a
product of GPG being somewhat 
"
unfashionable
"
 at present in favour of

"
new age
"
 technology issues. Also, the decision to retain a high
level of liquidity post Tyndall, while undoubtedly correct in the
longer term, has created a perception and, to a lesser extent, the
reality of lower returns in the shorter term.

The Board has considered an appropriate response to more closely
align corporate and market objectives and now proposes as follows -

1. An increase in dividend from 0.6p (0.545p adjusted for bonus
   issue) to 1.00p per share which will be paid as an interim for 
   1999. 

2. Suspension of the scrip dividend alternative.

3. A continuation of the policy of making an annual 1 for 10 bonus
   issue of shares (this year, after completion of the issue referred 
   to herewith).

4. The issue of up to 200 million 8% convertible unsecured notes of
   50p. Shareholders will have the opportunity to exchange at least 
   40% of their shares on a 1 for 1 basis. The principal will be 
   redeemed in 5 equal instalments commencing 30 June 2001 or, at the 
   option of the holder, the amount due for redemption in any year 
   may be converted back to shares (ex 1 for 10 bonus) at 50p in 
   2001, 55p in 2002, 60p in 2003, 65p in 2004 and 70p in 2005. 
   Fuller details of the proposed issue will be contained in a 
   Circular to be sent to shareholders. 

As the Company approaches its optimum size, an increased proportion
of profits will be available for distribution to shareholders. It is
hoped that the convertible note concept will introduce an exciting
new dimension for GPG investors and depending upon experience, may
become a regular feature of the Company
'
s future capital structure.

The year 2000 will be an active and, hopefully, rewarding one for GPG
although, of course, the profit will be substantially less than in
1999.

Cash Offer Facility for Staveley Industries plc

GUINNESS PEAT GROUP PLC

PRESS RELEASE

Guinness Peat Group plc (
"
GPG
"
) announces a cash offer facility to be
made by Deloitte 
&
 Touche Corporate Finance on behalf of GPG
Acquisitions No 3 plc (
"
GPG Acquisitions
"
), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of GPG, to acquire the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary
share capital of Staveley Industries plc (
"
Staveley
"
) other than the
33,774,700 Staveley Shares it already owns.

* The Offer facility is comprised of the Basic Offer of 60 pence per
Staveley Share, inclusive of the Special Interim Dividend declared by
the board of Staveley on 7 August 2000, and the 
"
ex dividend
"

Alternative of 25.6 pence per Staveley Share. The Offer facility
values the issued share capital of Staveley at approximately GBP69.8
million on the basis of the Basic Offer (or GBP29.8 million assuming
all Staveley Shareholders elect for the Alternative).

* Staveley Shareholders accordingly may, depending upon their
circumstances, either: 

- accept the Basic Offer under which they will receive as part of the
consideration (which should be treated as capital for tax purposes)
an amount equal to the Special Interim Dividend which would otherwise
have been payable on each of their Staveley Shares; or

- elect for the Alternative and, if eligible, retain the right to
receive the Special Interim Dividend (which will be treated as income
for tax purposes) on each of their Staveley Shares.

In either case, the Offer gives Staveley Shareholders an opportunity
to sell their Staveley Shares free of broking commission.

* The Basic Offer price of 60 pence represents a small discount to
Staveley
'
s pro forms net assets of 64.8 pence per Share and is
believed by GPG to be fair, after allowing for the settlement of
outstanding contingencies.

* The Offer is final and will not be increased. However, GPG
Acquisitions reserves the right to increase or otherwise amend the
Offer should a competitive situation arise or should the Panel
otherwise agree.

* The first closing date is 13 September 2000. For disposals under
the Offer to be valid on a 
"
cum dividend
"
 basis, sufficient
acceptances must be received to enable the Offer to be declared
unconditional prior to payment of the Special Interim Dividend,
currently expected to be on 29 September 2000. Therefore the Offer
will lapse if it has not become unconditional in all respects by 28
September 2000 (or immediately prior to any later date to which
payment of the Special Interim Dividend may be deferred).

Commenting on the Offer, Sir Ron Brierley, Chairman of GPG said:


"
Staveley
'
s recently declared special interim dividend of 34.4 pence
per Share will reduce its capacity to absorb future problems which
may occur in the businesses remaining after the disposal of British
Salt. If Staveley becomes a subsidiary of GPG, it will provide an
added measure of stability which will assist the management of the
operating businesses in a somewhat difficult market environment for
smaller UK listed companies.

The receipt of the Special Interim Dividend will have adverse tax
consequences for at least some Shareholders. GPG recognises the
imbalance between the level of its shareholding and that of other
Shareholders and the relatively illiquid market for those who wish
to sell their Shares prior to the dividend payment. Subject to GPG
receiving sufficient acceptances to increase its shareholding to over
50 per cent and to the satisfaction or waiver of standard protective
conditions, this Offer facility provides a certain cash exit for
those Shareholders who wish to sell their Shares.

COMMENTARY ON GUD
'
s RESULTS FOR YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2000

F2000 DEVELOPMENTS 
&
 OUTCOMES

The major developments and outcomes for the F2000 year were:

* Significant reduction in capital employed across each business,
through tight working capital management and strict capital
expenditure guidelines.

* Substantial increase in cash flow leading to a large reduction in
Net Debt and lower gearing levels.

* Strong sales and profit growth in Davey and Lock Focus.

* Significant continuing new product activities, generating revenue
growth in core products and resulting in a number of industry awards.

* New Managing Director and senior management appointments in GUD
Manufacturing to address remaining production inefficiencies with the
filtration automation project.

* Sale of non-core assets - Treco in December 1999 and Agrisales in
June 2000.           
               
KEY CORPORATE PRIORITIES

The key corporate priorities for the year, which continue into F2001,
were:

* The consolidation of the Cash Value Added measurement of business
unit performance. This has underpinned the improvement in cash flow
and gearing due to more management focus on the capital employed in
each business.

* Operational improvements - in both trading and investment measures
of performance. In F2001 this should come from a more stable trading
environment and resolution of the outstanding hurdles to operational
efficiencies in the filtration factory. Additionally, the supply
chain improvement project in Sunbeam Appliances will begin to
generate lower costs.

* The commencement of the Company-wide procurement program. This is
now beginning to deliver results in the form of lower costs of raw
materials and services.

DIVISIONAL RESULTS

CONSUMER 
&
 RURAL

\$ million       F00     F99     F00/F99 %

Sales           185.4   193.8     -4%

EBITA            11.8    13.3    -11%

EBITA/Sales       6.4%    6.9%

Consistent with the first half, the Sunbeam Victa business had lower
revenues for the full year. This is due to the favourable impact of
the gas and water crises in the prior year and the loss of revenue in
the current year brought about by the sale of the Treco business in
December 1999.

Profit in the Sunbeam Victa business was particularly affected by the
weak mower season in the Southern States and by competitive
conditions in the New Zealand appliance market.

The uncertainty in the market caused by the introduction of the GST
impacted results in the Appliance business in the last quarter.

The new product program continues to contribute positively to this
business unit
'
s results. During the year the launch of a new range of
irons, an upgrade to Sunbeam
'
s market leading frypan range and the
successful launch of new model woks were the highlights of this
program.

The product program for the Christmas season has been presented to
the retail trade and has received strong acceptance. The program
includes a range of home health products, broadening Sunbeam
'
s
product offerings into this new growth category.

The electric blanket season has been strong this year, due to cold
weather spells in late May and early June in both Australia and
New Zealand.

Iron production was relocated to China in the second half and this
has had a positive effect on margins.

Results from Victa were disappointing. The mower season commenced
strongly but unfavourable weather conditions through November and
December reduced demand. However, Victa maintained market share.

A new product line up, including Briggs 
&
 Stratton engines for the 4
stroke range and revamped 2 stroke products, has recently been
presented to Victa Gold Dealers for the forthcoming mower season. The
response has been enthusiastic and reflects Victa
'
s market standing.

The Sunbeam Rural business experienced a year of consolidation.
Restructuring has resulted in a much lower cost base. Aggressive
marketing programs initiated in the last two months of the year
created strong sales of shearing combs with good repeat orders. The
focus for Sunbeam Rural is to continue rebuilding its market position
in Australasian and export markets.

In a rationalisation of the Sunbeam Victa business, the Treco garden
sheds business was sold in December 1999 and the rural products
distribution business, Agrisales (NZ) Limited, was sold at the end of
June 2000.

EBITA/Sales         8.3%    8.9%

GUD Manufacturing
'
s revenues were affected by the consolidation
occurring in the aftermarket distribution sector. This resulted in
lower demand as distributors rationalised their inventories. 

A number of senior management changes were made in this business to
address the slow progress previously reported on the factory
automation project. A new Managing Director, with strong automotive
and operational experience, has been appointed.

Average daily output from the oil filter plant is now increasing in
line with internal targets and the remaining production
inefficiencies are being systematically addressed.

GUD New Zealand reported a solid trading performance for the year. As
advised at the first half, local market demand was strong and there
was a significant contribution from inter-company business with
Australia.

The Wesfil filter distribution unit had another strong year of both
sales and profit growth. Wesfil has been able to capitalise on the
changes occurring in the automotive aftermarket distribution sector
as well as growing market share from its branch network.

A record sales and profit result for the year was achieved by Goss
Products, an importer and distributor of automotive fuel system
replacement parts. Focused customer programs and new product
introductions contributed to this outcome.

coupled with tight controls on overheads and working capital
generated an excellent result for Davey Pumps for the year.

The growth resulted from a more focused approach to opportunities in
international markets, in addition to a favourable selling season in
the southern states and strong growth in the spa pump segment. Sales
in the New Zealand market continued to reach new records during the
year creating substantial market share gains.

With strongly growing revenues, this business maintained tight
controls over working capital and has generated substantial cash
flows. Consequently, the return on capital employed has improved over
prior year and is well in excess of the corporate cost of capital.

The Lock Focus business produced a very strong profit result for the
year. Sales grew in each major market segment - domestic OEM, export
and locksmiths.

The consequences of the rationalisation and consolidation of
operational activities undertaken in the prior year, are evident in
the profit increase. Improvements in working capital management,
especially in inventory, have contributed to a strong cash flow over
the year.

This business is now well placed to continue growing on the basis of
new product and market channel activities planned for the 2001 year.

We know of no specific reason for this particular change. We
nevertheless make the following comments for good order.

As stated in our last quarterly report released to the stock exchange
on 25 October, Southland Coal has been commissioning the extensively
refurbished longwall unit in the first longwall block in the large
Bellbird South area, 
"
SL2
"
. Production has indeed commenced. SL2 is
planned to its maximum length of 2 kilometres comprising 2 million
run-of-mine tonnes. The plan allows for the development of the
northeastern sub-panels of SL2 while the longwall unit extracts coal
from the developed southwestern sub-panel at the rate of 1.5 million
tpa.

As stated in our annual report dispatched to shareholders on 20
October, the Gympie Eldorado Gold Mine is now supplying to
international jewellery manufacturers the rich gold-veined Gympie
Gold-In-Quartz gemstone. Last week, another mine zone of such
material was discovered and some of the spectacular material
recovered. This is typical of the 
"
jewellers
'
 shops
"
 mine zones made
famous in the Gympie gold field last century. The potential of this
particular jewellers
'
 shop zone remains undefined and the ultimate
revenues from sale of the processed and finished gemstone products
will take up to six months to be realised. Such zones are expected
and have been accessed from time to time in the normal course of mine
operations. The likelihood of such discoveries recurring will grow is
mine production increases from last financial year
'
s production of
33,000 oz to the targeted level of 100,000 ounces per annum by the
end of calendar 2001, from high-grade ore.

HILL
Perth
PREAMBLE

After the wash-out experienced in the previous quarter, the
operations performed within the Board
'
s expectations for the June
quarter.

The underground mines were strong contributors during the quarter
with the Hill 50 mine continuing to increase in grade within the
virgin northern lodes. The average grade for the quarter from Hill 50
was over 5.0 g/t Au and more importantly the increasing trend in each
month of the quarter saw the grades in June average 6.0 g/t Au. Hill
50 has been developed to the 11 level (approx. 790m vertical) and
will over the next year reach the virgin main lodes at the 12 level.

The Star mine continued its intensive level development campaign to
set the mine up for stoping the smaller blocks, following the
decision in the previous quarter to abandon bulk long-hole open
stoping. It would appear from simple analysis that Star is producing
at an annual rate of 500,000tpa. However, it should be noted that
over 30% of the Star production came from development during the
quarter, which is a disproportionate amount to what would be typical
in the normal cycle. This is a function of setting the smaller stopes
(post bulk stoping abandonment) to contribute a regular and increased
ore flow. The Morning Star cluster now has nearly three complete
levels developed in advance of stoping.

Open pit mining was completed in the Milky Way pit. This pit
underperformed from the beginning and its completion was welcome. The
open pit production at Titan continued but was slowed down to be
commensurate with the requirement of this ore for mill blending. The
remaining strip ratio is under 0.5:1 and in the month of June, mining
for one shift gave the ore requirement for the whole month.

As well as Titan, the bulk of open pit production is now coming from
Black Cat South and the recently started Reno Pit. These will provide
the open pit feed into the blended ore stream for the next year.

The expanded Checkers plant began to perform strongly during the
quarter with throughput averaging over 330tph and record tonnage and
bullion production targets being broken during the quarter.
Processing costs averaging \$8.53 per tonne (quarter) reflected the
performance, despite continued high power costs (fuel price).

Exploration activity was subdued as resource drilling took centre
stage. However, a new discovery was made at Quasar NW, Jinx was
drilled out to a stage where an open-pit mine looks likely, and
O
'
Meara continued to show promise. Work around the old Perseverance
open pit revealed a likely pit extension and Reno and Black Cat south
continued to yield encouraging results for underground development

CHAIRMAN
'
S ADDRESS TO THE 14TH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you to the 14th Annual General
Meeting of Helix Resources NL.

The mining and exploration sector has been under scrutiny by
investors over the last twelve months. The advent of dot.com mania
has made times hard for the serious explorer seeking to raise
exploration capital.

I am going to spend a few moments offering some thoughts on our
industry.

Everything is either grown or mined, and since the beginning of human
existence, agriculture to provide food and mining to provide
implements, have been the keys to prosperity.

Throughout history, the great empires have risen and fallen according
to their ability to control the supply of food and metal to its
peoples. Today the great American prosperity is based on access to
such resources. It was no different in the time of Rome.

Gold because of its special properties and its beauty has been
crafted in different parts of the world for millennia before the
Christian era. Copper and iron have been key metals in mankind
'
s
progress, and other metals as they were discovered and brought into
production, have advanced civilization, each with their own
particular usage.

Nations with an abundance of agricultural land and geology suitable
for the discovery and mining of metals, should develop into
prosperous communities. In Australia, we have only to study our own
increasing prosperity, starting from the gold boom of the 1850s,
through all the various other booms associated with new activities,
to see the correlation with the improving lot of the people.

Like the United States which has led the world in both agricultural
and mining production and whose success today drives the world,
Australia can be a driver for the future. We live in a land well
endowed with nature
'
s gifts, but what do we do with it?

There are those who state that because in real terms, the long term
trend in metal prices is downward, the mining industry is crazy to
explore, and bring more metal into production. It seems to be less
appreciated, that because the consumption of metal rises
exponentially, the cost of production must fall, and therefore
prices, as larger and lower grade ore bodies are brought into
production, to meet this insatiable long term growth in demand.

In Australia, there is a concern that because the real rate of return
on capital employed in the mining industry, on a long term basis, is
less than 5%, that we should close off exploration and wait for the
supply and demand equation to arrest the metal price decline, and in
this way increase profitability. In my view this will be like waiting
for Godot!

A preferred strategy, which would accept the cyclical nature of base
metal prices and their long term downward trend, would embark on an
exploration drive, seeking to find not just ore bodies but bonanza
bodies - highly profitable ore bodies. There are such exploration
models. They may be very large or they may be high grade or a
combination of both. The Olympic Dam deposit on the, Gawler Craton is
one such body with over 2 billion tonnes of a copper-uranium
resource, with a copper grade of 13%. It is a truly remarkable body.

Over the last 200 years, world gold production has climbed from
around 16 tonnes per annum to presently 2550 tonnes, a compound rate
of growth in excess of 2.5% per annum. Unlike other metals, the long
term trend in the gold price is upwards with real terms growth of
0.5% per annum. Notwithstanding the antics of the world
'
s Central
Banks to hold down the gold price, the demand for the yellow metal
now exceeds mine production by some 1500 tonnes per year. This
shortfall equals 37% of world demand, or five times Australia
'
s
annual production.

It is met by the recycling of scrap and Central Bank sales. As with
other metals, the inexorable demand for gold, and indeed silver and
platinum for fabrication purposes, indicates to me the need to
discover bonanza precious metal ore bodies. 

Citizens expect Governments to improve national prosperity not
sabotage it. It seems unbelievable that the Government of a resource
rich nation like Australia, does not do everything within its power
to encourage the discovery of metals on its landmass. Australian
companies are spending an ever increasing proportion of their
diminishing exploration budgets offshore. This arises from
frustration on matters of land access, but also from a perception
that the Government doesn
'
t care.

The much vaunted Ralph Review to assist change in corporate taxation
would appear to offer little or nothing but harm to our industry. To
an explorer, the return of the old Section 77D deduction, or
something like the tax effective 
"
flowthrough
"
 funding in Canada,
would facilitate the raising of much needed capital for exploration.
Such action is necessary if we are going to find the bonanza deposits
the nation needs. Far from turning its back on exploration, the
nation needs an exploration drive beginning now!

Helix is a tried and tested explorer. It is searching amongst other
places, on the Gawler Craton - home of the Olympic Dam bonanza. We
have already had some limited success in gold at Tunkillia, and at
Moolah we have now identified an important breccia system containing
copper sulphides and gold. This is a brand new mineralised system
discovered by Helix and Mr Rob Mosig, our Managing Director, will
shortly give a run-down on it and other of our major activities
before we move into the formal business of today
'
s meeting.

We have two items of special business proposed for today
'
s meeting.
The first concerns the resignation of our Auditors Grant Thornton,
who have provided Helix Resources with tax and audit advice since
Helix
'
s incorporation in 1985 and subsequent listing on the
Australian Stock Exchange one year later. My fellow Directors and I
thank them for their fifteen years of help and advice.

Last year, members of the Helix Resources Audit Committee resolved to
call for tenders for the Helix external audit on a more frequent
basis. This resulted in the nomination of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu as
the Company
'
s auditors commencing with effect from the end of today
'
s
Annual General Meeting.

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu have consented to act as the Company
'
s
auditors and the Company proposes to appoint them today. Your Board
of Directors recommends this proposal to all shareholders.

The second item of Special Business concerns the approval of Director
and Employee Share Plan. There is no doubt that more Australian
companies are now offering both Directors and employees shares in
their company with the aim of increasing confidence and performance.
The plan proposed for approval at this meeting is one which aims to
align more closely, the Directors and employees interests with the
Company
'
s performance.

Participation is voluntary, and participating Directors or employees
may take up to 20% of their annual salary or fees, as shares in Helix
Resources. These shares are paid for by the participant from a salary
sacrifice and are kept for the participant by the Plan Trustee for a
minimum of three years from the date of acquisition or until the date
the participant ceases to be an employee or Director.

Financial assistance to be provided for the by the Company to
participants will be limited brokerage, stamp duty and administration
costs of the plan.

It is intended that the shares (to be allocated under the plan) will
be purchased on market and that no more that 60,000 shares are to be
offered to Executive Directors under the plan in the next 12 months
and that no more than 125,000 shares will be offered to Non Executive
Directors under the plan in the next 12 months.

Both these items of Special Business have been outlined in greater
detail in the Explanatory Notes to Shareholders attached to your
Annual Report and the Notice of Annual General Meeting. There will be
a short time to ask questions after the proposal of the Resolution.

Finally, I want to place on record the Directors
'
 thanks to the
Management for another successful year of exploration and to you our
shareholders, for your continued support.

Thank you.

HORIZON ENERGY INVESTMENT GROUP - ELECTRICITY PRICES

Horizon Energy Investment Management Limited (HEIML), the Manager of
the Horizon MACQUARIE Energy Investment Group (Horizon), wishes to
clarify recent events in the Victorian electricity market and their
potential impact on Loy Yang Power, in which Horizon holds 25% of the
equity.

It should be noted that: -

* Due to industrial actions, Yallourn Power Station has temporarily
ceased power production since 10 January 2000. As a result, regional
pool prices in Victoria have at times reached very high levels, and
in several instances exceeded \$100 per megawatt hours, during periods
of high electricity demand;

* In particular the Regional Reference Price (RRP) for Victoria on 3
February reached \$5,000/MWh (VoLL or the Value of Lost Load) for five
half hour periods and there was insufficient supply in Victoria to
meet demand resulting in load shedding:

* NEMMCO declared an 10th January 2000 that an Industrial Relations
Force Majeure (IRFM) event had occurred in Victoria. Under such
circumstances the National Electricity Code (the Code), provides for
the RRP to be 
"
capped
"
. These Price caps have been imposed and are
expected to remain in force until the Yallourn Energy dispute is
resolved.

* the value of the IRFM price cap is determined from a formula
detailed in Schedule 9A1.2 of the Code. The value of the cap varies
hourly throughout the day, and also has different profiles for
different seasons, and for work days versus non-work days;

* for the month of January 2000, the price cap ranges from
approximately \$50 to \$110 per megawatt hours on work days, and
approximately \$45 to \$65 per megawatt hours on non-work days.

Whilst Loy Yang Power
'
s revenue for January has benefited from its
exposure to the generally higher pool prices, investors are reminded
that a high proportion of Loy Yang Power
'
s generation revenue is
committed to vesting and hedge contracts which require the value
above the contract strike price to be repaid in the form of
difference payments. However, recent Victorian RRP
'
s are potentially
indicative of possible future reference prices when electricity
supply and demand comes into balance.

HORIZON ENERGY INVESTMENT GROUP
Sydney
REPORT FOR HALF YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1999 

The Directors of Horizon Energy Investment Management Limited, the
Manager of the Horizon Energy Investment Group, today announced the
financial results for the half year ended 31 December 1999.

The key financial results for Horizon for the period were: -

* Loy Yang Power recorded a \$16.9 million profit for the six months
to December 1999, of which Horizon
'
s interest was \$4.2 million.

* Horizon
'
s Operating Profit After Tax and Abnormal Items for the six
months to December 1999 was \$2.9 million

* Horizon
'
s available cash, after allowance for creditors, at 31
December 1999 was \$3.1 million.

* There were no distributions paid to unitholders during the period.

The table below shows the Key Financial Results for Loy Yang Power.

                                   6 MONTHS TO     6 MONTHS TO 
                                     31 DEC 99       31 DEC 98

                                   ---------------------------
Generation revenue                       249.9          232.4
Other revenue                             28.1           26.8
Total revenue                            278.0          259.2


Finance expenses                         159.5          151.3
Operating costs                            493           67.3
Depreciation                              52.3           51.0
Total costs                              261.1          269.6

Net operating Profit/(Loss)               16.9          (10.4)

Horizon quarter share                      4.2           (2.6)

Apart from the operating costs, the, results are comparable between
the, periods. In particular, generation revenue increased as a result
of a combination of increased output and a decreased exposure to the
spot market compared with the six months to 31 December 1998. The
reduction in operating costs was the result of the closure of a long
term liability existing at the time of purchase. Before this
adjustment, the operating costs are comparable with the previous
period.

ELECTRICITY PRICES

Electricity spot prices showed encouraging signs of recovery in the
winter months of 1999 but returned to more subdued levels in
September and remained around \$20 per MWh through the remainder of
the period. Very warm weather in mid January and early February 2000
saw substantially increased spot prices, however, this was partly the
result of reduced supply due to industrial action at Yallourn Energy.
This resulted in Industrial Relations Force Majeure (IRFM) being
called by NEMMCO with resulting price caps being imposed on the
Victorian market. In addition, the Victorian Government imposed
electricity usage restrictions in early February when it appeared
load shedding would occur.

In the absence of the IRFM, the January Victorian pool prices would
have been higher for Victorian generators. However, in most instances
the effect of the price caps was not significant except during the
days with warmer weather in mid January and early February, which saw
very high pool prices relative to the price caps during working
hours.

It is difficult to estimate how the market would have behaved in
early February in the absence of the Victorian Government imposed
restrictions on electricity usage. However on a number of days the
demand levels before restrictions were at record levels which would
indicate there could have been sustained periods of high prices.

CMS ENERGY CORPORATION 

On 14 February 2000 CMS Energy Corporation (
"
CMS
"
) announced. its
intention to sell its 49.6% interest in Loy Yang Power partnership.
Under certain circumstances CMS will require the approval of Loy Yang
Power
'
s lenders and other parties to enable the sale to proceed. The
impact (if any) of the proposed sale oil Horizon is not know at this
time.

OUTLOOK 

The Information Memorandum produced for the compliance listing
carefully set out the special circumstances faced by Loy Yang Power
including the forecast technical default of its senior lending
covenants in 2001 and likelihood of not being able to pay
distributions to Horizon for a number of years. It highlighted the
speculative nature of Horizon but also the potential capital gains
available to investors assuming that Loy Yang Power overcomes its
financial stress over the next three to four years and electricity
prices achieve or better the forecast price path. The Manager
believes this opportunity has not changed.

HOMESTAKE MINING COMPANY
Perth
Homestake Mining Company (NYSE: HM; Australia: HSM; Toronto: HCX)
announced today that it had completed sufficient work on its
60%-owned Veladero project in northwestern Argentina to declare a 4.8
million ounce proven and probable gold reserve (Homestake
'
s share:
2.88 million ounces) contained in 92.5 million tons of ore grading
0.052 ounces of gold per ton. The reserve, which also contains 0.71
ounces of silver per ton, is part of the recently announced and much
larger mineralized inventory totaling 7.8 million ounces of gold.
(Photo: NewsCom: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/19990326/HMLOGO)
The ore is expected to be sourced from two open pits before being
processed through a conventional mill and a heap leach facility. The
breakdown of the mill and heap leach ores is as follows (100% basis):

Ore Type    Tons      Gold Grade   Silver Grade   Gold        Silver
         (Millions)  (Oz per ton)  (Oz per ton)  (Millions   (Millions
                                                  of Oz)      of Oz)

Mill        18.5        0.145       1.40          2.68        25.8
Heap-leach  74.0        0.029       0.54          2.12        39.9
Total       92.5        0.052       0.71          4.80        65.7


"
When Homestake acquired Argentina Gold in 1999, we expected the
transaction to be accretive. It is very gratifying that half-way
through the first season of intense exploration and evaluation at
Veladero, we have been able to achieve a 6% increase in Homestake
'
s
gold reserves per share,
"
 said Jack E. Thompson, Homestake
'
s Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer. 
"
We are really just starting to learn
about the geological controls on the ore body and believe that there
is a lot more gold to be found on this highly prospective property.
"

The capital cost at this early stage of project engineering is
estimated at \$370 million. Preliminary cash costs are expected to
average approximately \$150 per ounce. Production is expected to begin
in 2003. Homestake is the operator of Veladero and owns the project
jointly (60:40) with Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: ABX; Toronto).
Homestake also announced that in the year 2000, it expects to sustain
its 1999 record breaking rate of production with an anticipated
output of 2.4 million gold equivalent ounces produced at an average
cash cost of \$189 per ounce. In 1999, Homestake produced 2.4 million
ounces at an average cash cost of US \$192 per ounce. The breakdown of
the projected 2000 production and average cash cost is estimated to
be as follows:

Operation     Location      Homestake     Attributable    Cash Cost
                            Interest      (000 Oz of     (US \$

Total                                      2,376           189

This projection is based on average Australian and Canadian dollar
exchange rates of US \$0.65 and US \$0.68, respectively. In 2000,
Homestake expects to spend approximately US \$70 million on its share
of capital expenditures and US \$30 million on exploration worldwide.

"
 that involve risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimated
results. Among the important factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially are the following: Estimation of reserve and
mineral inventory is an interpretive process based on drilling
results and past experience, as well as estimates of ore
characteristics and mining dilution, prices, costs of mining and
processing, capital expenditures and many other factors. Actual
quality and characteristics of ore deposits cannot be known until ore
is actually mined. Grades of ore processed may also vary from reserve
estimates due to geologic variations within areas mined. Production
may vary from estimates for particular properties and for the company
as a whole because of changes in reserves, variation in ore mined
from estimated grade and metallurgical characteristics, unexpected
ground conditions, mining dilution, labor actions, and government
restrictions. Cash costs may vary due to changes from reserve and
production estimates, unexpected mining conditions and changes in
estimated costs of equipment, supplies, utilities, labor costs and
exchange rates. Capital cost estimates are based on operating
experience, reserve estimates and expected production rates,
estimates by and contract terms with third party suppliers, expected
legal requirements, feasibility reports and other factors. Factors
involved in estimated time for completion of projects include the
Company
'
s experience in completing capital projects, estimates by and
contract terms with contractors, engineers, suppliers and others
involved in design and construction of projects, and estimated time
for the government to process applications, issue permits and take

completion to vary significantly from estimates. There is a greater
likelihood of variation for properties and facilities not yet in
production due to lack of actual experience.

IAMA LIMITED
Perth
IAMA today sought and was granted a greatly expedited timetable for
pre-trial procedures in the SA Supreme Court oppression action
brought against it by Futuris Corporation subsidiaries.

IAMA chairman Neil Roberts said IAMA was pleased with the timetable,
which was opposed by Futuris.


"
We believe it is important that this legal action be resolved as
quickly as possible, because it has the potential to disrupt the
Wesfarmers merger proposal,
"
 Mr Roberts said.

The timetable provides for IAMA to file its defence by Tuesday 29
August, with the parties to exchange categories of documents for
discovery by Friday 1 September and return to Court on Tuesday 5
September.

TRADING

Mr Snell the newly appointed managing director said the board had
today reviewed July trading results. He said 
"
Due to unseasonal
weather conditions and lower than expected sales, the Company
'
s
previously announced expectation of a profit in the second half will
be difficult to realise unless there is a marked upturn in
September.
"

INTERMIN RESOURCES LIMITED
Perth
As previously announced, Intermin is a significant shareholder in
HeartLink Ltd, which intends to seek listing on ASX. Intermin
shareholders have a priority right to 25% of the IPO.

HeartLink has the exclusive rights for Australia to commercialise
innovative technology for diagnosis of mental health.

Intermin is pleased to confirm that HeartLink has now been granted a
two year option to acquire patents and licence technology for use in
United Kingdom and France. These two options are granted in
consideration for the issue of 2.5M ordinary fully paid shares by
HeartLink.

The United Kingdom Option can be exercised by HeartLink by:

(a) the granting of 15M options in HeartLink exercisable at 50 cents
each on or before the expiry of two years from the date the options
were granted.

(b) the payment by HeartLink of a royalty of 5% of fees derived in
that region from the use of HeartLink technology, the first $300,000
of such fees are deemed be royalties prepaid.

The France Option can be exercised by HeartLink by:

(a) the granting of 15M options in HeartLink exercisable at 75 cents
each on or before the expiry of two years from the date the options
were granted.

(b) The payment of HeartLink of 5% of fees derived in that country
again with agreement that $300,000 of such fees are deemed to have
been prepaid royalties.

Based upon a combined population of 120M, the potential market now
available to HeartLink is expanded some seven times (compared with
Australia) with the addition of these two highly populated areas.
HeartLink still retains pre-emptive rights over the rest of Europe
and Asia.

The abovementioned 30 million options, if issued to the vendors, and
subsequently exercised, would see $18.75 million flow into HeartLink.
Assuming that listing is achieved within the parameters currently
proposed by the Directors of HeartLink, and based upon an exercise
price (of 50 cents) for the UK options, an implied market
capitalisation for HeartLink would be in excess of $40 million on a
fully-diluted basis.

Based upon an exercise price (of 75 cents) for France options, an
implied market capitalisation for HeartLink would be in excess of $70
million on a fully-diluted basis.

ISIS COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED
Melbourne
The Company announces its revised financial projections for the year
ending 31 December 2000. A foreshadowed in the Directors
'
 Report that
accompanied the half year results, the full year results are expected
to fall well below the financial projections that were contained in
the Company
'
s prospectus dated 22 July 1999 with the Company now
forecasting a loss for the year.

The principal reasons for the expected underperformance are:
increased amortisation rates for certain intangible assets; writedown
of intellectual property; proposed writeoff of certain capitalized
expenditure and equipment; significantly lower than expected
penetration levels for XSIQ: abnormal loss of \$5.01 million
associated with the Company
'
s primary role in World Reconciliation
Day held in Melbourne during September.

The revised projections in the form of forecasts for the year ending
31 December 2000, which are set out in more detail in the Company
'
s

s Statement that is expected to be lodged with ASIC on 18

Directors anticipate an improved performance in 2001.

The Company also announces a further restructuring of its business
following the launch of the initial phase of the online Business
Services directory which will result in a reduction in the ongoing
level of development activity. The Company is reducing its staffing
levels, particularly as a result of redundancies associated with the
reduced development activity over the current quarter, and is also
reducing overall corporate costs in order to reduce the cash
utilization rate.

IVANHOE MINES LIMITED
Sydney
Robert M. Friedland, Chairman of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., is pleased to
announce details of the company
'
s ongoing exploration program in
Northeast Kalimantan, Indonesia, which so far has recorded one gold
discovery and three base-metal discoveries.

SERUYUNG GOLD DISCOVERY: 
RESULTS REVEAL A NEW, MINERALIZED GOLD SYSTEM

Exploration at the company
'
s Seruyung gold prospect has resulted in
the discovery of a volcanic-hosted, high-sulphidation gold deposit,
which is reflected by widespread gold mineralization outlined in
surface and drill-hole results.

To date, 41 core holes have been drilled at Seruyung, totalling 7,864
metres, which indicate a resource of approximately 350,000 ounces of
gold. The central set of drill holes on the crest of Gunung Seruyung
outlined a significant zone of gold mineralization, referred to as
the main zone. This zone is consistent with the generalized model of
a high-sulphidation, epithermal system. The present model indicates
both structural and stratigraphic control of the gold mineralization
associated with a diatreme complex, resulting in a blanket of
mineralization peripheral to the feeder system. The near-circular
Seruyung diatreme is approximately 600 metres in diameter.

Of the 41 holes drilled, 33 intercepted gold mineralization with
assays greater than 0.5 grams per tonne (g/t) gold. A complete list
of the intercepts in all holes is posted on the Ivanhoe Mines website
(www.ivanhoemines.com) as an addendum to this release.

Intercepts include:

Hole    Intercept (metres)     Intercept and gold grade (grams/tonne)

SE001      0.00 - 73.45           73.45 metres @ 3.07 g/t

          66.10 - 67.70            1.60 metres @ 1.19 g/t
          82.00 - 83.88            1.88 metres @ 1.86 g/t
SE017       2.00 - 7.45            5.45 metres @ 1.34 g/t
          23.20 - 34.60           11.40 metres @ 1.25 g/t
SE033    87.80 - 110.75           22.95 metres @ 1.53 g/t
SE035     17.90 - 78.17           60.27 metres @ 1.04 g/t
         94.47 - 104.71           10.24 metres @ 1.15 g/t
SE038    55.90 - 108.42           52.52 metres @ 0.53 g/t

The potential to expand the indicated resource at the Seruyung
Project is considered high. Targets include near-surface
mineralization in receptive, permeable lithologies peripheral to the
diatreme and at depth in brittle, deformed contact zones within and
adjacent to the diatreme contact and in structural feeder zones. Grab
sampling across two-metre intervals from recent trenches on the
northern side of the diatreme yielded highly anomalous gold assays of
up to 3.6 g/t, and channel sampling has returned several significant
intercepts, including 19.4 metres @ 1.4 g/t gold (trench 22). Channel
sampling at one-metre intervals from two trenches in the Adah Raye
zone, 350 metres to the southeast of the main mineralized zone,
returned 96 metres @ 1.25 g/t gold (trench 13) and 31 metres @ 1.5
g/t gold (trench 12).

A trenching program is continuing to further evaluate and outline the
main resource at Seruyung and to delineate other prospective zones of
mineralization.

Additional work also will test a chain of three other
high-sulphidation prospects - Adah Isut, Dulun and Sinelak - in the
Seruyung district. These three prospects and the Seruyung prospect
appear to be associated with the east-northeast-trending Sembakung
lineament that is believed to have a major structural focus for the
mineralization at Seruyung. An initial five-hole, core-drilling
program at the Dulun prospect intersected high-sulphidation-style
alteration in a possible diatreme setting, but without significant
mineralization. 

LONG LAAI DISCOVERIES: 
BASE METAL/SILVER MINERALIZATION AT GUPAK AND MAMAK PROSPECTS

Exploration at the company
'
s Long Laai base metal prospect has
encountered significant intercepts of zinc mineralization in skarns.
The Gupak and Mamak prospects are located in the Long Laai area
within the southern Contract of Work which is 100%-owned by Ivanhoe
Mines. Exploration has identified significant base metal and silver
mineralization over several square kilometres within the Gupak and
Mamak skarn systems.

GUPAK PROSPECT 

The Gupak Prospect is outlined by extensive zinc and lead soil
anomalies over a three-kilometre-long zone, with rock-chip values of
up to 13% zinc. A widely-spaced drill program to test potential
mineralization is in progress.

A total of 15 core holes have been drilled, for a total of 1,457
metres. All but one of the holes intercepted mineralization that
assayed greater than 0.5% copper, 1% zinc and 1% lead. A complete
list of the intercepts in all holes is posted on the Ivanhoe Mines
website as an addendum to this release.         

Intercepts include:

(No results are presently available for holes GP013 and GP014)

These intercepts show significant grades, and several represent blind
intersections (below-surface mineralized intercepts in areas with no
surface mineralization). The large size of the Gupak skarn system,
coupled with the presence of economic grades and significant
thicknesses, indicate a high potential for the discovery of economic
stratiform and structurally controlled base metal/silver
mineralization. 

The drill rig is presently being moved to the southern soil anomaly,
approximately one kilometre from the previously drilled area.
Drilling to date has been on a reconnaissance basis and a detailed
drill program is planned to follow up on the significant mineralized
zones already encountered.

MAMAK PROSPECT

Ivanhoe Mines has begun an initial exploration program at the Mamak
Prospect consisting of geological mapping, rock chip and stream
sediment sampling and ground magnetics. The program is focused on the
area of the Mamak skarn that was drilled by the Bureau de Recherche
Geologique et Miniere (BRGM) in 1987 on a very wide spacing. BRGM
estimated that a resource of 300,000 tonnes at 13% zinc was inferred,
based on 12 diamond holes totalling 1,000 metres.

Previous soil sampling by the BRGM and sampling by Ivanhoe Mines has
defined a 500 ppm-plus zinc-in-soil geochemical anomaly over one
square kilometre, with extensions to the southeast. Further
delineation of targets is currently underway at Mamak and Ivanhoe
Mines expects to begin preliminary drilling later this year.

KELAPIS DISCOVERY: 
SEDIMENT-HOSTED COPPER-ZINC MINERALIZATION

Ivanhoe Mines has drilled 13 diamond holes, totalling 1,542 metres,
at the Kelapis Prospect, located in the company
'
s northern Contract
of Work in Northeast Kalimantan. Significant grades and widths of
copper and zinc mineralization were intersected.

All but three of the holes reported assays greater than 0.3% copper,
0.8% zinc and 0.8% lead. A complete list of the intercepts in all
holes is posted on the Ivanhoe Mines website as an addendum to this
release.

Intercepts include:

       92.2 to 135.7   43.5 metres @ 1.13% zinc

The best intersections occur along a north-northwest trend, which
remains open along strike. The copper mineralization appears to be
chalcopyrite and secondary chalcocite, whereas the zinc mineral is
predominantly sphalerite. Ongoing exploration at Kelapis is focusing
on determining the structural settings that control the
mineralization and extending the known mineralization along strike
and to depth.

Douglas Kirwin, Ivanhoe Mines
'
 Senior Vice-President, Exploration, is
overseeing the company
'
s exploration activities in Northeast
Kalimantan. All samples were analyzed at internationally accredited
P.T. Indoassay, based in Balikpapan, Kalimantan. In addition,
Strathcona Minerals Services conducted check assays on a number of
samples taken independently from the Seruyung drill core. The
Strathcona results show no statistical variations from those obtained
by Ivanhoe Mines.

Mr. Friedland said direct meetings have been held between
representatives of the company and Indonesia
'
s reform national
government. 
"
We have established a firm basis for an ongoing, working
liaison on issues of mutual interest and are encouraged by the new
government
'
s positive attitudes toward mineral exploration and
development.
"
   

Ivanhoe Mines is also conducting exploration on prospects in Myanmar
and South Korea. The company will release additional information on
its exploration activities as appropriate.

Ivanhoe Mines has 74.4 million shares outstanding and had a cash
balance of approximately US\$46.6 million on February 29. The

Kimberley is very pleased to report that the applications by Argyle
and the State of Western Australia to strike out Kimberley
'
s Supreme
Court actions have resulted in orders by consent which are directed
at facilitating the expedited hearing of all of Kimberley
'
s claims
before the Supreme Court.

An undertaking has been given that a registrable transfer of the
Ellendale Mining Lease will not be given to any third party without
Kimberley
'
s written consent unless the Court subsequently orders
otherwise.

The real issues will now finally go before the Court and Kimberley is
optimistic about the outcome, if the matter is not settled to

KAGARA ZINC LIMITED
Perth
MT GARNET (100%)

INFILL/DEFINITION DRILLING

During the quarter Kagara completed 6288 metres of reverse
circulation (RC) and 1737.25 metres of diamond drilling. The
infill/definition drilling was completed subsequent to the quarter
end. In total 8,816 metres of RC drilling and 3,438.25 metres of
diamond drilling have been completed at Mt Garnet since the program
commenced in February 2000.

A reverse circulation drill rig remains on site to complete
sterilisation and geotechnical drilling.

RESOURCE

Infill drilling of the resource has now been completed on a 20 metre
x 25 metre pattern. This pattern has been closed up to 10 x 10 metres
in some areas. The table attached contains all significant assays
received since the issue of Kagara
'
s report for the March quarter.
Some of the better intersections are summarised below.

GTR 16        30 metres @ 11.66% Zn from 67 metres
GTR 37        29 metres @ 10.32% Zn from 52 metres
GTR 43         9 metres @  8.3 % Zn from 84 metres
and           10 metres @ 16.85% Zn from 125 metres
GTR 48        34 metres @ 10.08% Zn from 70 metres
GTR 51        54 metres @ 7.45% Zn from 42 metres
GTR 55        12 metres @ 10.55% Zn from 121 metres
GTR 57        19 metres @ 12.61% Zn from 28 metres
GTD 73         8 metres @ 19.08% Zn from 63.2 metres
GTD 79        30 metres @  8.77% Zn from 116 metres
GTD 82        60 metres @  6.34% Zn from 125 metres

Assay results for the remaining holes will be announced to the market
when they come to hand.

The longsection accompanying this report shows the detail of drilling
and the current interpretation of the orebody at Mt Garnet. The
principal outcome of the infill drilling was the confirmation of the
continuity of the high grade shoots. The shoots are outlined by the
+200 metre % Zinc contour on the plan. The mineralisation at Mt
Garnet remains open at depth and down plunge. 

It is anticipated that the final assay results and analytical data
from the infill drilling will be to hand during August. Once
incorporated into the database the process of interpretation and
orebody modelling will take place. This will result in an
independently calculated resource, during the September quarter. 

The resource will then be the subject of detailed open pit and
underground mining studies as part of the feasibility study.

METALLURGY 

Metallurgical test work, which is progressing well, is expected to be
completed within the next few weeks. 

Subsequent to the quarter
'
s end, a successful pilot plant programme
has been completed at Ammtec
'
s facilities in Perth. Both zinc and
copper concentrates produced from this programme will be used to
provide samples for physical testwork and optimisation studies.

FEASIBILITY STUDIES

During the quarter contracts were awarded for the design of waste
rock and tailings dam and concentrator and infrastructure design.
Work continued on tailings and waste rock characterisation studies
and various contractors were appointed to conduct specific tasks
associated with the Environmental Management and Overview Strategy
(EMOS). These included flora and fauna, soil, noise, and European and
Aboriginal heritage studies.

The EMOS is a consultative study and as such Kagara has made contact
with relevant stakeholders in the area including traditional
Aboriginal owners, local councils, government departments,
pastoralists and towns-people.

WALSH RIVER (100%)

No field work was undertaken during the quarter. Drilling is
scheduled for later in the year and will be designed to test
geophysical and geochemical targets outlined in Kagara
'
s Prospectus.

Walsh River has the potential to host several moderate tonnage but
high grade +15% zinc deposits. The inferred resource at King Vol is
1.27 million tonnes @ 9% ZnE. It is believed that further detailed
drilling may result in an increase in grade of this resource.

ADMIRAL BAY (option to acquire 100%)

Kagara continued the review of this prospect and is assessing options
for the advancement of the project.

CORPORATE

On 19 June 2000, Kagara reached agreement with Perilya Ltd to acquire
their entire interest and rights in the assets of the Mt Garnet and
Walsh River Joint Ventures.

Under the agreement Kagara will assume a 100% interest in the
projects from Perilya, superseding the existing farm-in agreement
under which Kagara had an exclusive right to earn 50% by spending \$3
million, with an option to increase to 75% by paying Perilya \$1.5
million. 

Consideration for the acquisition, which will see Perilya
emerge with an initial 14% stake in Kagara, is: 

* the issue to Perilya of 6.9 million shares - 5.75 million of which
can be issued upon settlement of the transaction with the balance
requiring shareholder approval; 

* a payment of \$0.5 million in cash; and 

* the issue, subject to shareholder approval, of a two year secured
\$2.25 million Convertible Loan Note, convertible at 35 cents per
share in the first year and 30 cents per share in the second year.
The Convertible Loan Note is redeemable at any time at Kagara
'
s
election and carries a coupon interest rate of 8% per annum.

The transaction is subject to completion of formal documentation and
relevant regulatory and other third party approvals where applicable.

An Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders has been called for
Friday 25 August 2000 to approve the various issues and Convertible
Note.

GENERAL

Kagara is listed on the ASX under the code KZL and has 42 million
shares on issue. At 30 June 2000 Kagara has a cash balance of \$3.4
million and no debt.

LEIGHTON HOLDINGS LIMITED
Sydney
CORPORATEFILE.COM
Leighton Holdings Limited at its recent AGM received shareholder 
approval for the purchase from HOCHTIEF of 20 percent of Leighton 
Asia, giving it full ownership. As of the end of June, Asian markets 
accounted for 37 percent of Leighton
'
s work in hand, up from 20 
percent a year earlier. Which markets and sectors are driving Asian 
growth? 

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
Our geographical and product diversification is driving growth.

Two to three years ago, Hong Kong and Indonesia dominated our Asian
operations and we were largely in contract mining, civil and building
construction. Since then we
'
ve developed significant work in
Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. In Thailand we
'
ve gone into
rail work thanks to the John Holland acquisition. In Malaysia, we
have \$520 million of work in hand. We are also pursuing some good
opportunities in the Philippines. In Indonesia, we remain strong in
the mining market, through both Thiess and John Holland.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Which markets and sectors are expected to drive your growth in Asia
going forward?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and the Philippines will
remain our principal markets. We
'
re also positioned for a 
"
new dawn
"

in Indo-China, where we
'
ve maintained a presence.

Telecommunications is a potential market and we
'
ve formed a joint
venture between Vytel, Leighton Contractors
'
 telecommunications arm,
and Leighton Asia to pursue opportunities in the Asian markets. We
expect to develop business through that entity within the next 12 to
24 months.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
What impact has the Asian economic crisis had on the markets?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
The impact varied from country to country. The major impact to us was
in Thailand, where we were largely in building. That market died.
However, John Holland had a strong presence in rail in Thailand and
that acquisition has turned our Thai business around and opened up
new opportunities.

In Indonesia, we experienced no major impact as we were mainly in
resources, which were largely unaffected by the crisis.

In Malaysia, at the time of the crisis, we only had a small presence.
More recently, we have won two large jobs, which has pushed us
forward.

In Hong Kong the private sector went dead after the crisis and remains
quiet. The public sector is providing work in Hong Kong driven by
government expenditure programmes in housing, rail and roads. The
Philippines was the least affected by the crisis, but their current
political difficulties have resulted in poorer returns due to the
lower Filipino peso and some market uncertainty.

That
'
s the reverse of profits repatriated out of Hong Kong and
Indonesia, which are in or tied to the US dollar.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Has there been a change in the competitive environment?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
In Thailand, foreign contractors have tended to hang in and fight for
the remaining market at fairly constrained prices. If we were to
remain in the basic Thai civil and building market we couldn
'
t make a
buck. We
'
ve had to do something different.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Where in the cycle are the Asian markets at present, and when do you
expect the next peak/trough in construction activity in those
markets?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
It
'
s largely going to be driven by foreign investment and lending.
That
'
s how the last cycle was driven - by demand to create factories
and open up mines for export.

In Indonesia, demand for coal in particular has remained strong on
the back of the cheap Indonesian rupiah.

In the other markets, we are slowly seeing a renewed interest by
multi-nationals in investment. Even in Vietnam, investors are
looking at opportunities but I wouldn
'
t venture a guess about when
the cycle will turn at this stage.

We don
'
t necessarily look at these countries in terms of inherent GDP
growth and local construction activity. Our major opportunities are
driven by offshore financing. Hong Kong is the exception.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
What impact will full ownership of Leighton Asia have on your balance
sheet and the funding of future projects?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
Zero in terms of funding because it
'
s been an 80 percent subsidiary
and funded from the group. The major impact will be on earnings given
an improved Asian result and better returns for Leighton Holdings in
that we paid a fair price for the 20 percent. Our earnings from Asia
should improve EPS in the medium term.

CORPORATEFILE.COM
The operating profit margin (before tax) on your Asian operations
improved to 7.1 percent in 2000, up from 6.9 percent. What has driven
this improvement?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS
We have been focused. This should allow us to maintain margins in
that part of the world.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Leighton is currently trading on about 12.5 times historic earninqs
of 51.1 cents per share, a discount of about 35 percent to the All
Industrials suggests that investors remain concerned about the
outlook for building activity in Australia. Are you anticipating a
sharp slowdown in your order book in Australia?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
It
'
s already happened in construction. The post-Olympics slowdown
started about 12 months before the Olympics. The spate of projects
associated with the Olympics has stopped and no new major projects
are coming through the books.

However, there
'
s a whole swag of road and rail projects being talked
about, particularly by the New South Wales state government, but the
only one that has a possibility of getting up in the short term, in
our view, is the Cross City Tunnel.

So the pure construction sector has tightened, there are fewer
opportunities and margins have tightened. The returns we
'
re getting
out of the construction sector are down compared with where we were 2
or 3 years ago, however this sector accounts for less than a third of
our business.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Is it likely that Asia will account for more than 50 percent of your
order book in the near term?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
It
'
s unlikely. Our Asian order book is at a record level and in the
short to medium term, it should stay at high levels. But in
Australia, we have taken a number of initiatives outside the
construction sector particularly in the mining area, which should
allow us to maintain a strong order book.

Remember we have a massive footprint in contracting in Australia
through Leighton, Thiess and John Holland and we will get our fair
share of new work as it comes through. 

Our challenge is to make sure that the work we get is profitable,
good quality work. We continue to focus on the major turnkey projects
where there is a higher risk but better margins, which contribute to
our shareholders
'
 returns.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Will growth in Asia offset the slowdown in Australia, enabling you to
maintain profit growth?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
It
'
s happening. The level of our Asian order book suggests that
revenue and profit contribution from the region this year will be
higher in a relative sense, offsetting any drop in turnover and
profitability coming out of the Australian construction sector. We
expect the mining sector to hold up in Australia, but the
construction sector will contribute less.

CORPORATEFILE.COM
When do you expect a recovery in Australian building activity?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
We expect the cycle to start to come through again post 2002.

In the mean time, we
'
re pursuing a number of major projects by taking
an active sponsorship role. If some of these projects happen, the
multiplier effect is immediate.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Will the emerging cash flows from telecommunications and environmental
services be different in nature from the more traditional building
and construction cash flows?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
That was the whole logic in going into those areas. Our aim has been
to diversify geographically and by industry, and environmental and
telecommunications were part of that.

Environmental has been a success story for us. We have \$200-220
million a year worth of work in that sector now and we expect to keep
growing it, albeit not massive part of our business like mining. So 
its relative contribution to revenue will remain modest.

The long-term growth area, besides our core activities, is
telecommunications. We are focused on supporting major clients like
Testra and Optus and some of the new players like Vodafone and
OneTel.

Telstra is currently the dominant provider of work and we are winning
a share of that - for example the \$520 million 5-year contract for
construction and maintenance of their National Telepower Network
through Silcar, a joint venture between Thiess and Siemens.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Leighton acquired 70 percent of John Holland in February 2000 and
later bought selected contracts from John Holland Asia. What impact
do these acquisitions have on Leighton
'
s Asia-Australia mix?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
They
'
ve had a positive impact on the mix. They
'
ve given us more work
in Thailand and more mining work in Indonesia.

In Australia, the 70 percent acquisition has given us a \$500 million
boost to work in hand. In the first six months, Holland was at
break-even, which is what we expected. But currently, they
'
re in the
black and we expect them to produce a profit in the year to June
2001.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Given its low margins, why did you acquire John Holland?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
Because of their engineering reputation, client base and rail
presence.

We expect over time to improve their margins by improving their focus
and cost control. It
'
s a good move for us.

CORPORATEFILE.COM
Will you acquire the remaining 30 percent of John Holland?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
Our agreement states that at the end of 5 years, that 30 percent
reverts to us.

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Dr Hans-Peter Keitel, a HOCHTIEF director and Leighton board member,
has publicly stated his company
'
s interest in raising its stake in
Leighton to over 50 percent from the current 49.9 percent. What
implications would a HOCHTIEF majority holding have for the
management of Leighton going forward?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
HOCHTIEF are seeking to go over 50 percent so they can consolidate
our results. We
'
ve had extensive discussions with them and agreed
that management and the board should continue as they have in the
past. HOCHTIEF
'
s stated position is that they have a successful
investment, which they want to maintain.

CORPORATEFILE.COM
Leighton
'
s final dividend for 2000 was unfranked and you have flagged
an unfranked dividend for the first half of 2001. What is the outlook
for dividends and franking going forward?

CFO DIETER ADAMSAS 
We pay out about 65 percent of our profit in dividends. If our
overseas earnings continue to strengthen, that will put further
pressure on our franking ability. We are looking to go back to
franking, but can
'
t unequivocally say dividends will be fully franked 
after this next interim dividend.

I would expect the 2001 final dividend be franked to some degree, but
it
'
s too early to judge to what extent

CORPORATEFILE.COM 
Thank you Dieter. We look forward to our next Open Briefing with
Leighton Holdings.

MEDIA RELEASE

NETWORK STRENGTHS KEY TO MAYNE GROWTH

Mayne will leverage its strong market positions in each of the
industry sectors of health care and logistics and ensure it is the
most efficient, quality service provider under its strategic
development plan announced today.

Detailing the outcome of the group
'
s strategic review, Mayne
'
s Group
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Peter Smedley, said
the group was establishing a network business model which would allow
Mayne to maximise returns from its business portfolio.

The group also unveiled a new, unified brand for use across all its
businesses to ensure Mayne fully realises the benefits of its strong
market positions in health care and logistics.


"
An important focus is to ensure we can leverage the full benefits
and efficiencies within the group
'
s existing networks,
"
 Mr Smedley
said.


"
We will get this business base right and strengthen our position in
our home market of Australia, while developing a cost culture that
will allow us to translate organic revenue growth onto the bottom
line, returning the business to industry benchmarks.
"
"
A key driver to achieving growth is the transportable and scalable
business model that we are putting in place.
"
"
This business model allows us to unlock integration benefits and
provides a platform for further growth.
"
"
We have a strong balance sheet and a business that generates cash.
Going forward, this will support material growth, both organic and by
strategic acquisition.
"
"
As opportunities present, we will deepen our involvement offshore,
notably in the growth markets of Asia - where we already have a
viable foothold.
"
"
Our business model is underpinned by our organisational structure
and management competencies in supporting efficient business
networks,
"
 Mr Smedley said.

Pan of the strategic review was an assessment of the group
'
s business
portfolio. This led to the recent divestment of the UK express
operation and Mayne
'
s move to acquire Australian Hospital Care.

The significant increase in equity associated with the gain on the
sale of the UK business, and the equity raised to allow for the
Australian Hospital Care transaction would reduce Mayne
'
s gearing
significantly, placing the company in a strong balance sheet position
for ongoing growth.

The offer to acquire Australian Hospital Care was a good example of
Mayne
'
s strategy going forward. Australian Hospital Care would
enhance the group
'
s position as Australia
'
s premier private hospital
operator. The combined entity will have 29 per cent of the private
hospital market nationally.


"
Significant opportunities for integration synergies exist in the
areas of head office consolidation, applying our network approach to
facilities and procurement,
"
 Mr Smedley said.


"
These synergy benefits are expected to be fully realised by the end
of the 2002 financial year.
"


In addition, substantial diagnostics opportunities existed through
the provision of pathology and diagnostic imaging services to
Australian Hospital Care hospitals.

The Mayne strategic review identified the key internal factors that
were being addressed to maximise returns for shareholders. These
included:

* a poor cost culture;
* lack of cross-business and intra-business synergies;
* a confused market identity; and
* poor integration of acquisitions.

Mr Smedley said the group had undertaken a series of initiatives to
address performance. These included:

* a streamlined organisational structure supported by shared
  services;
* central groupwide purchasing to significantly reduce overall spend
  on consumables;
* move to common IT platforms and a reduction in the current \$115 
  million annual expenditure for voice, mobile and data systems. For
  example, the 30 current logistics IT systems would be reduced to 
  one common warehouse management system, and a single, proven 
  express parcel management system imported from the Canadian and UK 
  express operations;
* greater outsourcing of non-medical hospital services;
* improving staffing flexibility within hospitals;
* greater use of management software to better identify hospitals
  costs, and to identify measures to reduce the average length of 
  stay for patients;
* improving relationships with general practitioners through the
  utilisation of practice management tools and administrative 
  support; 
* integration of New South Wales pathology businesses, including the
  consolidation of operations at the new North Ryde laboratory;
* completion of integration of logistics and express operations; and
* adoption of unified branding.

Mr Smedley said the projections for improvement in the group
'
s
financial performance through measures already undertaken were:

* bottom-line benefits arising from the corporate restructure, which
  had been completed;
* margins from the group
'
s New South Wales pathology operations were
  expected to meet industry benchmarks by the end of this financial
  year;
* synergy benefits from the Australian contract logistics business
  (formerly called MPG Logistics) would emerge by the end of 2001;
* the full integration benefits from the consolidation of logistics
  and express operations in Australia would be achieved by mid-2002;
* returns from the hospitals network would exceed its cost of capital
  by the end of 2002; and
* earnings, margins, gearing and earnings per share and return on
  shareholder equity for 2001 would show improvement over the 
  previous corresponding period.

Place: Level 8, No. 1 Martin Place, Sydney, NSW

Mr David Clarke, Chairman of Macquarie CountryWide Management
Limited, has been appointed in writing by Macquarie CountryWide
Management Limited to chair the meeting of unitholders.

SPECIAL BUSINESS

To consider, and, if thought fit, pass Resolutions 1 and 2.

RESOLUTION 1: RATIFICATION OF PLACEMENT

To consider, and, if thought fit to pass the following special
resolution:

THAT for the purposes of Rule 7.4 of the Listing Rules of the
Australian Stock Exchange Limited and ASIC Class Order 98/52 as it
relates to clause 4.6 of the constitution, the previous placement of
28 million units in the Trust, outlined in the explanatory statement
accompanying this notice convening this meeting, be ratified.

RESOLUTION 2: APPROVE ADDITIONAL PLACEMENT 

To consider, and, if thought fit to pass the following special 
resolution: 

THAT for the purposes of Rule 7.1 of the Listing Rules of the
Australian Stock Exchange Limited and ASIC Class Order 98/52 as it
relates to clause 4.6 of the constitution, the proposed placement of
14 million units in the Trust, outlined in the explanatory statement
accompanying this notice convening this meeting, be approved.

Both resolutions must be put to a meeting of unitholders who hold at
least 25% of the value of all units in the Trust and who are entitled
to vote in person or by proxy. It can only be approved if at least
75% of the value of units voted at the meeting are in favour.

For Resolution 1, the Manager will disregard any votes cast on the
resolution by persons who participated in the placement (refer
Appendix 1) and their associates. For Resolution 2, the Manager will
disregard any votes cast on the Resolutions by persons who may
participate in the proposed issue (refer Appendix 1) and their
associates, and persons who might obtain a benefit, except a benefit
solely in the capacity of a unitholder, if the Resolution is passed,
and their associates. However, the Manager need not disregard a vote
on any Resolution if it is cast by a person as proxy for a person who
is entitled to vote, in accordance with the directions on the proxy
form or it is cast by the person chairing the meeting as proxy for a
person who is entitled to vote, in accordance with a direction on the
proxy form to vote as the proxy decides.                 

RECOMMENDATION

The Manager believes that the proposals are in the best interests of
all unitholders. The Manager therefore recommends that you vote in
favour of the resolutions.

HOW DO YOU EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE?

All unitholders appearing on the Trust register of unitholders at
10.00 pm (Sydney time) on Friday 8 September 2000 are entitled to
attend and vote at the meeting.

The vote on all resolutions must be conducted by way of a poll. You
have one vote for each dollar of the value of the total interests you
have in the scheme. If your unit is jointly held, only the vote of
the person named first in the register counts. You need not exercise
all of your votes in the same way, nor need you cast all of your
votes. 

INDIVIDUALS

If you plan to attend the meeting, the Manager asks that you arrive
at the meeting venue at least 10 minutes prior to the time designated
for the meeting so that the Manager may check the value of your units
against its register of unitholders and note your attendance.

CORPORATIONS

In order to vote at the meeting, a corporation which is a unitholder
must appoint a person to act as its representative. The
representative should either lodge with the unit registry before the
meeting or bring to the meeting evidence of his or her appointment
including any authority under which it is signed.

VOTING BY PROXY

If you cannot attend, you may appoint up to two proxies to attend and
vote for you. Your proxy does not need to be a unitholder in the
trust. If you appoint two proxies you may specify the proportion or
number of votes the proxy is appointed to exercise.

To ensure that all unitholders can exercise their right to vote on
the proposed resolution, a Voting and Proxy Form is attached together
with a reply paid envelope.

Instructions for completion of the Proxy Form are set out on the back
of the form.


EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

PLACEMENT OF UNITS AND UNIT PURCHASE PLAN

The Trust has under contract two properties in Australia and thirteen
properties in New Zealand. The property characteristics and financial
output from these properties match the investment strategy of the
Trust and should provide a positive contribution to the Trust
'
s
distributions.

Macquarie CountryWide Management Limited successfully completed an
institutional placement raising approximately \$60 million on 20 July
2000.

The raising involved an unconditional placement of 28 million partly
paid units at a price of \$1.40. The units are initially paid to \$0.90
with the balance of \$0.50 due on 31 March 2001. A further issue of 14
million partly paid securities is intended to be made on the same
terms subject to unitholder approval at the unitholder meeting. If
approved at the unitholder meeting these additional units will be
allotted and issued by 1 October 2000.

All of the partly paid units issued will rank for distributions on a
pro rata basis with respect to their paid up value and the period
from 1 October 2000. For the six months ending 31 December 2000 the
partly paid ordinary units will receive an entitlement equal to
32.14% of the fully paid units and for the six months ending 30 June
2001 an entitlement equal to 82.24% of the fully paid units will be
paid. The partly paid units will not be entitled to participate in
the UPP. In all other respects the units will rank equally with the
ordinary units on a pro rata basis to the paid up amount.

If the meeting of unitholders passes both resolutions the Manager
will be able to forward the Unit Purchase Plan offer document to all
Unitholders to subscribe for up to \$3,000 of CountryWide ordinary
units after the unitholder meeting. The issue price for these units
is proposed to be \$1.40, subject to market prices prior to the date
of offer. At this price, Unitholders will be able to apply for a
minimum of 360 units and a maximum of 2,140 units. The record date
for entitlements to the UPP offer is proposed to be 21 September
2000, the offer would close on 13 October 2000 and units would be
allotted and issued by 30 October 2000. Units issued under the UPP
will rank fully for distribution entitlements from 1 July 2000.

The funds raised will be used to: 
* initially reduce gearing thus enabling the trust to make 
  acquisitions as opportunities arise; 
* fund in excess of \$23 million in income producing capital 
  expenditure identified within the existing CountryWide portfolio.


FURTHER INFORMATION

Unitholders with questions concerning this proposal should telephone
the Manager on 1300 365 585.

LAVERTON EXPLORATION JOINT VENTURE - Metex 50%

OVERVIEW

The Laverton Exploration Joint Venture (LEJV) is a 50:50 joint
venture between Metex and Delta Gold Ltd (Delta), and covers an area
of approximately 540sqkm in Australia
'
s premier exploration terrain -
the Laverton Tectonic Zone (see Figure 1). Metex is the exploration
manager for the joint venture and Delta the development manager.

Metex retains 100% ownership of all other minerals apart from gold,
together with the Lancefield lease and contained gold resources
therein.

STATUS OF DEFINED GOLD RESOURCES

The total of oxide gold resources within the LEJV is 8.4 million
tonnes @ 2.3 g/t or approximately 620,000 ounces of gold (see
Appendix A). As previously advised, at current gold prices the
present resource inventory is insufficient to justify the joint
venture constructing its own mill. This outlook changes significantly
if exploration success leads to the delineation of additional near
surface deposits. Such an outcome has the greatest potential to add
significant value to the project and underpin a decision by the joint
venture to establish or acquire its own mill.

To this end, the LEJV has been aggressively pursuing the delineation
of additional resources at a number of high quality exploration
targets throughout its Laverton landholding. By the end of the
Quarter approximately 6,000m of RAB, aircore, and RC drilling have
been completed. This is despite the period being one of the wettest
in the northeastern Goldfields on record. The programs not completed
as a result of the weather have been re scheduled for the June
Quarter.

EXPLORATION

RED FLAG PROJECT

RED FLAG

Additional aircore and RC drilling has been completed to follow up
the encouraging results at Red Flag reported in the December Quarter.
This exciting new prospect is 17km south west of Laverton and has a
history of widespread alluvial gold production. To date no bedrock
source for this substantial alluvial occurrence has been found.

73 aircore drillholes for 3350m have been completed on widely spaced
traverses targeting what is thought to be the stratigraphic
equivalent of the Beasley Creek horizon, the prospective host for
mineralisation at Beasley Creek approximately 20km to the north.
Drilling has now traced this horizon beneath relatively shallow cover
around the nose of the Mt Margaret anticline, a major regional
structure separating the Laverton area from Mt Morgans in the west.

Results have now identified anomalous supergene gold over three
kilometres of strike length. Within this more extensive blanket a
core zone of approximately one kilometre has been delineated where
results range up to 7m @ 2.0g/t from 6 to 13m followed by 1m @ 7.4g/t
from 16 to 17m in RFAC331, 3m @ 3.3g/t from 25 to 28m in RFAC340, and
4m @ 1.8g/t from 65 to 69m in HNAC038. 

These are early stage results from an area of recognised potential
that has not been the subject of any modern day exploration. Further
drilling is planned as soon as ground conditions enable drill rig
access.

LANCEFIELD PROJECT

LANCEFIELD NORTH

At Lancefied North historical IP and EM geophysical data from surveys
completed during the 1980
'
s has been reprocessed. These surveys were
successful in defining the northern extensions of the various
mineralised horizons located at Lancefield. The reprocessing shows
that 1.2km of the Lancefield Main Lode (historical production in
excess of 1.3 million ounces) together with 2.5km of West Lode
horizon has not been adequately tested by drilling completed at the
time. Better results from the drilling completed included 2m @
16.1g/t and 2m @ 12.4g/t from the Main Lode, and 8m @ 3.8 g/t and 1m
@ 33.2g/t from an interflow sediment located above West Lode. Depth
of cover in this area is shallow. Drilling of these prospective
horizons is expected to commence as soon as ground conditions permit.

GARDEN WELL NICKEL PROGRAMME (METEX 100%)

During the Quarter a comprehensive review of the nickel potential of
the Laverton leases was completed. As a result, a very prospective
basal channel position in the Red Flag ultramafic has been identified
as having potential for magmatic nickel sulphides. The target is 2
north striking magnetic anomaly coincident with a prominent gravity
high. The feature has a strike length of about 500m and is thought to
be a basal channel of ultramafic that has cut into 2 basaltic
substrate. The footwall sequence includes sediments thought to be a
prospective source of sulphur for contamination of the channel melt.

Drilling of this site has commenced.

WESTERN AUSTRALIAN PROJECTS 

No fieldwork was completed on either the Mt Morgans or Roe project
areas during the Quarter.

VICTORIAN EXPLORATION 

The Company together with Forrestania Gold is in joint venture with
MPI Gold Pty Ltd (
"
MPI
"
) and Pittston Mineral Ventures Australia Pty
Ltd (
"
Pittston
"
) over its Byrneville/Wallup tenements (PL 3941) to
the north of one of Victoria
'
s premier goldfields at Stawell. MPI and
Pittston have an entitlement to earn up to 75% in the tenements by
spending \$1 million within 4 years.

To date MPI have completed an integrated exploration programme
involving aircore drilling, geochemistry, and geophysics to locate
geological settings similar to Magdala at Stawell.

Soil sampling is currently underway in the Byrneville area, while
aircore drilling has commenced testing the Kewell target. Mineralised
volcanogenic rocks on the western flank of an underformed basalt dome,
similar to the Magdala setting have been intersected. Results are
awaited.

Approximately 10,000m aircore drilling, together with an EM
geophysical survey are expected to be completed during the June
Quarter

METEX RESOURCES LIMITED
Perth
Further to the Company
'
s announcement of the 31 August 2000 Metex
Resources Limited is pleased to announce that re assays from
individual metre samples from first pass reconnaissance RAB drilling
from one of two RAB traverses completed testing a new gold in soil
anomaly delineated by earlier vacuum drilling, has significantly
upgraded the potential for near surface high grade mineralisation.

RAB drilling across Target 5H (part of the 50/50 LEJV with Delta Gold
Limited) has intersected 4m @ 28.00g/t Au from 21m in BGB033
(including 1m @ 96.7g/t). Visible gold has been panned from the
interval. Follow up RC drilling has commenced. The intersection is
hosted in a weakly foliated, strongly ferruginous zone in a strongly
deformed and altered felsic intrusive. An intersection in an adjacent
hole include 4m @ 368ppb Au from surface in hole BGB034. The holes
are drilled at 600 to the west.

There is no evidence of any historical mining activity in the area
and it lies approximately 1km to the east of the known Chatterbox
deposits (620,000 contained resource ounces of gold). The new
discovery is beneath less than 5m of transported cover, and again
highlights areas close to known mineralisation as increasingly
prospective 
"
brownfields
"
 environments.

Additionally, as part of the recently announced Drilling Pool
initiative concluded with drilling company Grimwood Davies Pty Ltd,
programs at Roe (Metex 100%) and Mt Morgans (Metex right to earn 70%)
are about to commence. Both areas have demonstrated exploration
prospectivity and the potential to host large gold or base metal
deposits. The use of the drilling pool allows the Company the
opportunity to rapidly evaluate the areas without materially
impacting on cash reserves.

The Roe program involves RC drilling and will follow up RAB results
(including 4m @ 1.06g/t between 60-64m in RRB201) at Goat Dam East.
These results are from a structurally complex area in banded iron
formation. It is only recently that Metex has assumed 100% ownership
of the area. Little or no exploration has been completed in recent
years.

At Mt Morgans detailed aeromagnetics at 50m line spacing has
highlighted two areas that form part of the joint venture with Heron
Resources NL. Strong magnetic responses have been returned from a
sequence of felsic volcanics along strike from outcropping anomalous
base metal gossans. The magnetic response is interpreted as being the
result of magnetite alteration, possibly indicating the presence of a
concealed volcanic centre. RAB drilling of these targets is due to
commence shortly.

MARYMIA EXPLORATION NL
Perth
QUARTERLY REPORT - PERIOD ENDING 30 JUNE 2000

This report details exploration activities of Marymia Exploration NL
(Marymia) for the quarter ending 30 June 2000.

1. MINARA GOLD PROJECT

The Minara Gold Project is a single exploration licence, E37/473,
covering approximately 120 square kilometres of greenstone. The
Project, a Joint venture with Delta Gold Limited, is located 40
kilometres east of Leonora some 220 kilometres north of Kalgoorlie,
Western Australia.

The Delta Joint Venture requires the incoming party to fund all
exploration through to decision-to-mine to earn a sixty five percent
interest. Marymia retains an interest of thirty five percent and may
at decision-to-mine elect either to contribute to mine development in
accordance with it
'
s interest or reduce to a twenty percent interest
carried to mining with the development capital cost being reimbursed
out of the Project
'
s cash proceeds.

During the June quarter Delta has carried out a comprehensive
exploration programme in readiness for RAB and RC drilling planned
for the September quarter. This work has included acquisition,
processing and interpretation of detailed aeromagnetics, detailed
geological mapping, hole relogging and selected assaying and
orientation geochemistry.

The RAB drilling programme is scheduled to commence early in August
2000 with RC drilling in September. This work will mostly focus on
the Sligo Creek Prospect where previous RAB drilling identified
extensive, elevated bottom hole gold results, coincident with a
strong magnetic anomaly and alteration of the mafic volcanics

MEDIA RELEASE

MAGNETIC DRAWS STRONG RESPONSE TO \$4.5 MILLION FLOAT

INVESTORS RESPOND TO AUSTRALIA
'
S NEWEST MINERAL SANDS COMPANY

Magnetic Minerals Limited is set to list on the Australian Stock
Exchange on Wednesday 18 October after closing its \$4.5 million
Initial Public Offering (IPO) fully subscribed. The Company lodged a
Prospectus last month for the issue of 15,000,000 Shares at an issue
price of 30 cents.


"
We are very pleased with the investor response to this exciting
opportunity, which centres on Magnetic
'
s strategic landholding in the
heartland of Australia
'
s established mineral sands industry,
"
 said Mr
Alan Hill, Director of State One Equities Pty Ltd, Underwriter of the
public issue. 


"
The fact that international gold producer, Ranger Minerals Ltd, was
prepared to take up approximately 33% of the issue at 30 cents is a
strong endorsement of the quality of the float,
"
 Mr Hill said.

Magnetic
'
s Chairman, Dr Alistair Cowden, said the enthusiastic
response reflected investor recognition of the value of the company
'
s
Dongara deposit and support for its strong management. 


"
This success is a strong vote of confidence in the Company and our
plans to quickly progress this quality asset to producer status,
"
 Dr
Cowden said.

Magnetic
'
s immediate priority will be to undertake an intensive six
week, 11,500 metre drilling program at Dongara commencing within two
weeks of listing to test six of 16 high priority targets. This
represents the first stop in a three phase drilling program planned
by Magnetic.

Magnetic
'
s flagship Dongara Project - totalling 271sqkm and located
immediately north of the Eneabba Mine - encompasses nearly all of the
prospective ground within the Eneabba Mineral Field not owned by
Iluka Resources and includes a resource of 20 million tonnes at 6.6%
heavy minerals with an in-situ value of A\$230 million.

The existing drilled resource at Dongara covers a strike length of
just 6.9 kilometres out of the 39 kilometres of high-quality
strandline targets delineated to date, underlining the significant
potential to swiftly increase the resource.

Following the issue, the Company will have approximately 31,650,000
shares on issue, capitalising it around \$10 million at the 30 cent
issue price.

MERCHANT HOUSE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
Perth
The Board of Merchant House International Limited wish to advise that
the Company has today entered into two agreements in relation to 59.6
acres of land in Shunde, China.

The first agreement is a 
"
Transfer of Use of Land Right
"
 whereby the
Shunde Township allows the Company the use of the land for
construction of a factory. The consideration payable to Shunde
Township is RMB 8,394,540 (A\$2 million), and the term of land use is
50 years.

The second agreement is a contract with Shunde Investment Company
whereby the Company agrees to build a factory on the land for which
it has the right of use. The capital cost for the construction of the
factory will be up to US\$2.5 million (A\$4.8 million).

The factory will be a two story steel structure building which will
enable the Company to double its production capacity in order to meet
anticipated future demand. The Company proposes to fund the right of
land use from internal funding, and will finance the factory
construction through borrowing
'
s from the Bank of China.

HIGHLIGHTS

* Eight million shares were placed in March to raise a total of
\$600,000. The Company now has on issue 110,397,506 shares and 942,000
staff options.

* Mr Brian Currie has been appointed to the Board of Directors as a
non-executive director. Mr Currie was, until recently, Managing
Director of Tektronix Australia Pty Limited.

* E4fax Limited (50% owned by Michelago) has successfully established
its first beta test site for the E4fax product and two others should
be established with a month. Commercial sales are expected by the end
of the June quarter.

TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS

As previously announced, the Company has made two acquisitions
outside of the minerals industry.

E4fax Limited (Michelago 50%) is commercialising the E4fax software.
E4fax software enables fax transmissions to be managed under Internet
Protocol.

During the quarter E4fax was further refined and is now operational.
Successful installation of the first beta testing was achieved with a
Melbourne based insurance group in early April. Two further beta
sites are to be installed at operations in the transport and
manufacturing industry sectors in the next few weeks. The beta test
sites represent the final stage prior to broad commercialisation of
the software. E4fax Limited expects the product to be commercially
available by the end of June.

Inventory Management Systems Pty Limited (IMS) has been incorporated
to manage, market, develop and sell the STOCK*MAN software and
associated software products (the Minder series). STOCK*MAN utilises
spread spectrum radio frequency (RF) and barcode scanning technology
to automate the receiving of inventory, put away, picking, label
printing, production line management and serial number tracking.
STOCK*MAN can be scaled to meet the requirements of major enterprises
or small-medium enterprises.

The Minder series is a spin-off from STOCK*MAN, for those
applications where the full functionality of a STOCK*MAN system is
not required. The Minder series software uses barcode technology to
track assets, inventory, collections or time. The Minder products are
being developed as 
'
off the shelf
'
 stand-alone packages. 

CORPORATE

At the end of March a placement of eight million shares was made to
clients of Investa AG. The placement raised \$600,000 as additional
working capital.

As a result of the placement, Michelago has on issue 110,397,506
shares and 942,000 unquoted employee options with various expiry
dates.

Mr Brian Currie, who has had a long career in the technology industry
has been appointed to the Board of Directors as a non-executive
director. Mr Currie recently retired after twelve years as Managing
Director of Tektronix Australia Pty Limited. Mr Currie
'
s extensive
marketing and sales experience will be invaluable to IMS in expanding
opportunities for the STOCK*MAN and Minder series products.

MINERAL EXPLORATION PROJECT STATUS

The Company holds a portfolio of mineral exploration projects in the
Lachlan Fold Belt of NSW. The Company is actively seeking to farm-out
those projects that are not currently joint ventured.

Location of the Company
'
s projects is shown on Figure 1.

Sipa Option

The Company
'
s option over Sipa Exploration NL
'
s interests in joint
ventures with Michelago was allowed to lapse. Michelago currently
holds a 49% interest in the Parkes JV, a 25% interest in the Cow flat
JV and a 24.5% interest in the Wisemans Creek JV. Michelago is
earning a 75% in the Dimaseer JV.

Mount David 
&
 Abercrombie 
(Michelago reducing to 20%)

Herald Resources Limited is earning an 80% interest in the project.
During the quarter mapping and surface, multi-element geochemical
sampling was conducted over the western areas of the tenements. The
areas tested are freehold farming land and not subject to Native
Title. The remaining tenement areas are still involved in the Right
to Negotiate Procedures.

Two significant soil sampling anomalies were identified along with a
number of scattered low-order anomalies.

At Mount David sampling produced an east-west gold anomaly on a
single sample line with a peak of 820ppb gold. It is possible that
this anomaly is associated with a line of old workings. Ground
checking will be undertaken.

In the Gilmandyke-Bunnamagoo area an irregular shaped 600m x 300m
gold anomaly was outlined with a peak of 280ppb gold. This area has a
coincident arsenic and radiometric anomaly and requires ground
checking and additional sampling to determine the anomaly
'
s
significance.

A number of spot high values ranging from 280ppb gold to 4150ppb gold
failed to repeat in split samples. Further laboratory checks are
being undertaken. 

Breadalbane 
(Michelago 100%)

A consultant was commissioned to review the project. The review
included reconnaissance mapping of previously identified target areas
to assess their potential. The style of previously discovered
mineralisation has been reassessed to reflect current geological
research with a result that the region is considered to have
excellent potential for gold and copper-gold deposits.

Burraga 
(Michelago 25% of expanded area)

Michelago and Telminex NL (a subsidiary of Marlborough Resources NL)
have agreed to merge their tenements in the Burraga-Lucky Draw area.
It is proposed that Michelago will hold a 25% interest in the
combined area. A project report is being compiled which will
highlight the exploration targets. Discussions are being held with
the Department of Mineral Resources to enable a new exploration
licence to be granted over the area.

Other Projects

No field-work was undertaken on the Company
'
s other mineral
tenements.

FINANCE

As at 31 March 2000, the Company had \$886,000 in cash at bank and as
security deposits (149,000). This includes the proceeds from the
placement of eight million shares at 7.5 cents each.

Exploration for the quarter was \$21,000 and the forecast expenditure
for the June quarter is \$25,000.

GENERAL

The information in this release pertaining to the Company
'
s mineral
projects has been compiled by Mr R N (Sam) Lees (Managing Director of
the Company) who is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of
Geoscientists and The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy
and who has more than five years experience in the field being
reported. This report accurately reflects the information compiled
by Mr Lees.

Acquires Controlling Interest in Sydnet`s M4 Toll Road

MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP
Sydney
Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Limited (MIIML), as
Responsible Entity and Macquarie European Infrastructure plc
(MEI plc), today announced that Macquarie Infrastructure Group (MIG)
has signed a binding legal agreement to acquire a 50.6% controlling
interest in Statewide Roads Limited, the holder of the concession for
the M4 toll road in Sydney. The agreement is subject only to the
approval of the Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW and MIIML believes
it will be able to satisfy the relevant requirements set out in the
Concession Deed. Settlement is expected by the end of the year.

The M4 toll road is a part of the M4 Motorway, which runs from
Strathfield in the inner west of Sydney to Penrith at the foot of the
Blue Mountains.

The M4 purchase is forecast to generate a pre tax internal rate of
return of 16.0%, after valuing franking credits at 100% of face
value. If franking credits were valued at 50% of face value (as per
current MIG policy) the forecast IRR is 11.6%, which compares
favourably with the returns of MIG
'
s other investments in both listed
and unlisted toll roads. The purchase will provide MIG with ongoing
cash flows and provide an increased level of imputation credits to be
attached to distributions. The average cash return in the first five
years is 12.0% per annum.

The acquisition cost for the controlling interest in Statewide Roads
Limited will be \$153.3 million. This is a higher price than
originally proposed when MIG held an exclusive agreement with the
vendors last year. The change relates to a number of factors
including:- 

* The certainty of lower corporate tax rates in Australia in 2001 and
2002 now that the reductions have been legislated; and

* Statewide Roads Limited having increased cash and franking credits.

MIG will fund this latest acquisition via a combination of cash
reserves and a draw down under existing short-term debt facilities.
MIIML and MEI plc are considering a number of long term financing
options including term debt, asset sales and equity. No rights issue
is contemplated.

The M4 is a strategic acquisition for the MIG portfolio. It is more
mature than MIG
'
s other toll road assets, providing a balance to
projects in the early stages of development, such as Midland
Expressway in the UK and the Rostock toll tunnel in Germany. The
acquisition will enhance the cash flows already resulting from MIG
'
s
investments in Hills Motorway and the M5 toll road. Future cash flows
will continue to strengthen as traffic and revenue grows on the
Eastern Distributor and Transurban.

This acquisition reinforces MIG
'
s position as one of the largest
owners of toll roads in the world with more than 1.1 million vehicles
a day using toll roads in which MIG has a significant interest.

REDFIRE RESOURCES LIMITED
Perth
FOCUS ON PRODUCING EARLY CASH FLOW

Redfire Resources Ltd (ASK:RFR) today announced that it will acquire
a major position in the world class Broken Hill Silver-Lead-Zinc
minerals field and agreed to purchase a process plant designed to
treat Broken Hill ore.

Redfire has reached agreement on principal terms to acquire from
Normandy Mining Investments Pty Ltd, the Consolidated Mining Lease No
7 (CML 7) title, which covers the central 3.8 kilometres of the
Broken Hill orebody.

Redfire has also agreed on principal terms to purchase the company
Pinnacle Mines Pty Ltd which includes the Pinnacle Mine located 18
km south of Broken Hill), equipment and a processing plant designed
to mine and treat Broken Hill ore.

The total consideration for the acquisitions of CML 7 and Pinnacle
will be \$2.5 million worth of Redfire shares plus \$3 million cash in
staged payments.

Remnant open cut and shallow underground silver, lead, zinc resources
are present within CML 7 together with unmined parallel lodes, the
Western and Centenary Mineralisation. There is also potential to
develop a number of untested indicated ore targets.

Redfire Managing Director, Mr Bob Besley, said the Company will
concentrate on generating early cash flow from ore stockpiles and
open cut reserves and will undertake a complete review of all of the
historical mine and drill data to identify additional masses of
remnant ore and exploration targets.


"
Despite the 117 years of mining at CML 7, considerable potential
remains. Very little exploration has been undertaken on the
repetition of the Broken Hill mineralisation to the east of the main
line of lode and projections of ore along major structures have
remained unexplored.
"
"
We will also focus on further exploration of the large tonnage
zinc-lead Western Mineralisation to define higher grade portions,
suitable for underground mining,
"
 Mr Besley said.

PINNACLE PROCESSING PLANT 

The processing plant at the Pinnacle Mine is designed to treat both
oxide and sulphide ore and has a current capacity of about 90,000
tonnes per year. It is proposed to increase the capacity of the mill
by adding a new water line, a primary crusher, a second ball mill and
further storage pads.

Mr Besley added that processing of ore could begin shortly as Redfire
has also acquired the rights to treat approximately 250,000 tonnes of
stockpiled Broken Hill ore. Assessment of the stockpile will commence
immediately.

BROKEN HILL PRODUCTION HISTORY 

The Broken hill orebody has produced over 200 million tonnes of high
grade silver-lead-zinc ore, representing in today
'
s metal prices, a
total revenue value of greater than \$70 billion.

CML7 includes the original site of discovery of Broken Hill in
September 1883 and the original mining site of the Broken Hill
Proprietary Company Ltd (BHP). Capital generated from CML7 funded the
industrialisation of Australia.

Since discovery, open pit, underground and remnant mining from what
is now CML7 has produced more than 50 million tonnes of ore, grading
around 12.5% lead, 6.5% zinc and 280g/t silver. Production was
dominated by BHP in the early stages (13 million tonnes), then Broken
Hill South Ltd (20 million tonnes) and most recently Minerals Mining

&
 Metallurgy Ltd (4 million tonnes).

Remnant tribute mining on CML7 of mixed oxide-sulphide ore by
Pinnacle Mines and Barrier Developments took place from 1993 to 1998.
The ore was selectively mined and batch treated at the Pinnacle mine
site.

A due diligence study by Redfire has confirmed an earlier estimate by
Minerals Mining and Metallurgy that CML7 has open cut resources and
reserves of 1.61 million tonnes containing 7.9% lead, 175g/t silver
and 4.6% zinc.


"
Except for the tribute mining undertaken by Pinnacle and Barrier,
all past production was during a time of very high royalty, taxes,
freight and labour costs hence only very high grade ore was mined.
There is significant potential for near surface reserves
"
. Mr Besley
said.

Redfire Director, Professor Ian Plimer, said 
"
In my 30 year
association with Broken Hill, the combination of CML7 and Pinnacle
Mines presents the unique opportunity to maximise the value of the
near surface remaining resources and to evaluate significant known
mineralisation.

NONFERRAL RECYCLERS LIMITED
Melbourne
The board of Nonferral Recyclers Limited wishes to announce that its
wholly owned subsidiary Nonferral (Asia) Pty Ltd has signed a letter
of intent to establish the Chinese aluminium recycling and ingot
manufacturing plant recently announced. The letter of intent has been
signed with the Ming Hoe group of companies of Chang An in Guang Dong
province, China.

The letter of intent provides for each of the Ming Ho Group and
Nonferral Recyclers Group to each invest A$400,000 in the technology,
plant and equipment necessary for the operation of a plant at an
initial capacity of 50,000 mt per annum.

The Ming Hoe Group will provide the land and buildings and
infrastructure necessary for the operation of the plant whilst
Nonferral Recyclers Group will provide the technology and management
to operate the plant, procure the necessary scrap and sell the ingot
through its world wide trading network.

The plant is expected to be operational by mid 2001 and at full
capacity by the end of next year and is intended to supply export
markets throughout Asia.

Mr Zhaoming Sun, the Principal and Chairman of the Ming Hoe Group,
has indicated he wishes and is willing to provide additional capital
to further increase the capacity to 100,000 mt per annum in 2002
after the initial capacity level has been achieved during 2001.

In the interim period and in addition to the above Nonferral (Hong
Kong) Ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of the Nonferral Recyclers Group
will toll recycle aluminium in Nan Hai, also in Guang Dong Province,
with initial trials expected to commence this week.

The production in China will increase the presence of Nonferral
Recyclers throughout the Asian region.

NUPLEX INDUSTRIES LIMITED

Attached is a copy of the Chairman
'

Annual General Meeting of the company to be held at Ellerslie
Convention Centre, Auckland, New Zealand at 11.00am today.


CHAIRMAN
'
S STATEMENT NOVEMBER 2000

The next item on the agenda is my report to you on the progress of
the company.

I intend to make a comment on the year gone by, report on progress
since balance date and to share with you some of the changes, which
will be occurring in the future. Any questions or comments I will be
pleased to receive under the final agenda item.

The board is proud of the progress made by the company in the 1999/
2000 year. The result signals that the integration phase of the
Australian Chemical Holdings Company into Nuplex is virtually
complete as well as introducing additional growth opportunities as we
pursue our policy of growth in Australia and New Zealand in our three
core businesses - Resins, Construction Products and Special Waste
Treatment.

Your Directors are also pleased that the quality of our earnings and
cash flow was such that we were able to reward our loyal shareholders
with a 43% increase in dividend with 100% imputation credits, despite
investing in four acquisitions during the year. This maintains our
policy of distributing 50% of our tax paid profit.

Shareholders often ask why we do not increase this percentage. My
only answer is that if we run out of growth opportunities, we can
distribute 100% profit. But in the meantime we believe we strike a
fair balance, offering both earnings and growth.

We are pleased to note that the synergies arising from the
acquisition are now being reflected in reduced operating cost, which
in turn is improving our earnings as a percentage of sales.

The four acquisitions made during the year, two in the resin business
group, one in the waste treatment business and one in the building
products business are examples of the growth opportunities available
to us. These acquisitions were made for cash but by year-end the
debt, as a percentage of debt plus equity, was back to the 49% at
which we started the year through the strong positive cash flow
generated by the businesses. 

The new acquisitions did not make a full contribution in the 1999/
2000 year, therefore there will be additional benefit accruing in the
current year.

The first four months of the current year have given the company a
favourable start with profit well ahead of the same period last year.
The geographic and business diversity have, once again contributed to
the continuing good performance.

Not every business segment is prospering. For example, the downturn
in the New Zealand housing construction market is having a dampening
effect, but increased investment by the buoyant primary industries
and the retail sector is making up for any slow down to achieve
growth in the construction material business. While strong recovery
of the waste treatment earnings in both Australia and New Zealand is
also contributing to the growth we are experiencing. 

The first four months does include several special situations some
with a positive effect on the business environment, some with a
negative effect and others with an indeterminate effect. We have
experienced the introduction of:

* GST in Australia 
* the Olympic Games build up 
* followed by the Olympic Games 
"
holiday
"
 which has really only come 
  to an end towards the end of October 
* record strengthening of the US dollar against local currencies 
* escalating global prices for oil and petrochemicals 
* and in New Zealand increased government induced costs.

With these varying influences at work it is difficult to establish a
meaningful trend the only certainty is that we are experiencing a
volatile business environment. On balance, however, the positive
opportunities outweigh the negative signs and there are no reasons to
suggest that the rest of the financial year will not meet the
company
'
s expectations. The board believes that the strong first
quarter confirms the view expressed in the Annual Report that the
company is set to continue its history of earnings growth.

Positive earnings contribution are expected from:
 
* additional synergy gains from last year
'
s acquisitions 
* strong recovery of the waste businesses 
* increased penetration of the Australian construction products 
  market 
* and growing contribution from our Asian involvement including the 
  Vietnam operation. 

These positive contributions are expected to outweigh any downside
effects from further escalation of petrochemical costs and the slower
level of housing construction in our home markets to ensure that we
maintain strong double digit growth in the current year.

The only disappointment of the past year was the lack lustre
performance of our share price. I am sure that you were as frustrated
as your directors were as the price bounced about at levels way below
most commentators
'
 valuations. 

We were not alone on the New Zealand Stock Exchange to suffer this
fate as many large investors switched their money out of New Zealand
into US and European markets and out of old economy stocks into
dotcoms and other e-Commerce stocks.

When the tide is running against you like that, there is not much we
as directors can do to stem the flow, except to ensure we generate
quality earnings and to try to keep the market as well informed about
the operation as possible. To assist on this process we have opened a
web site at www.nuplex.co.nz. This includes an investor relations
section that is updated regularly.

Two of the reasons particularly given for down rating our shares have
been the perception that Nuplex is not a growth investment and that
our fortunes are dominated by the construction industry. If people
look more closely at the company they would see that our profit
performance shows a compound annual growth rate in excess of 10% over
the last 10 years with plenty of opportunities still to come. Hardly
a no growth company. The reality of our business mix is that the
construction industry comprises less than 40% of our exposure with
the remainder of our income generated from a very wide spectrum of
the economy including leisure, packaging, paper, printing, food,
textiles, infrastructure, transport, roading, in fact most areas of
our daily lives involves products which use Nuplex products in some
form or other.

Since the end of the year I am pleased to note that there has been an
improvement in the market
'
s perception of our shares which I am
pleased to see rewarding you, our loyal shareholders.

An indication of the increasing interest in Nuplex shares is given by
an increased participation in our dividend reinvestment plan. 50% of
the final dividend was taken in the form of shares compared to only
26% for the final dividend last year. 

I would now like to bring you up to date with some changes that will
be occurring in our organisation.

I have advised the board of my wish to retire from the role of Chief
Executive effective 31 December 2000. The Directors have asked that I
stay on the board as chairman and that in addition to this role that
I give 50% of my time to a special role which I will come to later. I
am pleased to accept this new role. 

These are three reasons for my decision: -

Firstly, after 46 years in the industry, 35 of them in this company
with the last 19 years as Chief Executive I feel that the time has
come to take a little time for myself as I am not getting any
younger.

Secondly, the major move into Australia has bedded down very well
with the development of a very strong integrated management team and
a clearly defined ongoing growth plan. The 1999/2000 results confirm
the correctness of the move.

Thirdly, and most importantly we are indeed fortunate in identifying
an extremely capable replacement and it is with great pleasure I
record the board
'
s decision to appoint John Hirst as Managing
Director of the company effective 1 January 2001. 

John is currently Chief Executive of our Australian operations and
has proved himself with the success of our growth in that market.
Having worked with John during his 35 years
'
 growth with the company,
I have complete faith in his proven ability to manage the company
well and I know that he is absolutely dedicated to the success and
continued growth of Nuplex.

John joined Nuplex in 1967 as a chemist responsible for product
development and customer technical service. This quickly led to a
sales management role. In 1977 he transferred to our Australian
subsidiary to boost our growing exports to the Australian market and
to investigate the options for investment in resin manufacture in
that country.

At the time, it was decided that given heavy overcapacity in the
Australian resin industry, it was unwise to invest in additional
grassroots capacity and growth was more effectively generated through
exports from New Zealand. In 1985 John returned to New Zealand to
take on the role of General Manager of the Resins business.

In 1995 John returned to Australia as chief executive of our
Australian subsidiary which by then had established a resin
manufacturing base through acquisition. John was well positioned in
this role within the Australian industry by 1998 when we acquired
Australian Chemical Holdings to become Australia
'
s largest resins
manufacturer. John ably led the team that effected the very
successful merger of the two businesses in Australia. 

In appointing John as Managing Director it is recognised that it is
best for him to remain based in Sydney given the balance of the
group
'
s business interests, with significant operating plants in four
cities in New Zealand, four cities in Australia and one in Vietnam.
Over 70% of our revenue is generated outside New Zealand and our
major growth opportunities are also in Australia and Asia, which will
be more readily managed from a Sydney base.

The board however considers it appropriate to continue to maintain
the head office in New Zealand recognising the fact that 80% of our
shareholders are domiciled in this country. The Chairman will
therefore be based in Auckland. In addition, the new executive
structure provides for the Chief Financial Officer to continue to
reside at the head office. Modern methods of communication ensure
that such a structure is very workable.

To assist in a smooth transition and to support the New Zealand head
office function the board have asked that in addition to my role as
non-executive chairman I give a further two years service to the
company in a special role based in New Zealand. I have undertaken to
devote 50% of my time to Nuplex interests. This role will focus on
shareholder relations and service on the boards of our major
subsidiaries and joint ventures. I will also be available for any
other support as required by the Managing Director to assist in the
future success of our business. In this respect we have agreed that I
can add future value to the company through involvement in building
our corporate quality culture, in specific growth projects, and in
maintaining strategic relationships, I look forward to using my
skills and knowledge to provide this support to John and his
Executive.

The board is confident that with the changes and the new structure in
place, the company is well positioned to continue the successful
growth of Nuplex in Australia and New Zealand to form a strong base
on which to build our growing involvement in Asia.

On a more personal note I would like to take this opportunity to
thank firstly our loyal shareholders for your support of the company
over many years. I also thank those newer shareholders for your
wisdom in seeing the vision for the future of Nuplex. On thing you
can rely on is management
'
s dedication to improving long term
shareholder value through being the lowest cost provider of superior
customer satisfaction in a safe and environmentally friendly manner
working with well trained experienced and fulfilled staff. 

I would also like to thank the management and staff of Nuplex, both
past and present for their support over the years. They have been a
great team to work with and to lead. I have always enjoyed the
working environment within Nuplex and consider it a great bonus.

I would like to publicly thank our founder and Life President for the
opportunity and guidance he gave me in the early years.

As a final indulgence I would also like to record my heartfelt thanks
to my wife Celeste and family for their support.

Thanks for the forbearance during the weeks and months I was away
during the build up of our involvement in Australia and Asia and
during the establishment of our key international technical
associations. 

Thanks for the faith and support during the rough patches and for
fulfilling that essential role of keeping my feet on the ground
during the excitement of the successful periods. 

Everything would have been much more difficult and stressful without 
you. 

I look forward to the new phase of my career that I am moving on to
and I will take great pleasure as Chairman in presenting good results
to you for many years to come.

I am happy to take questions on these matters or any other matter
affecting the company but I propose to leave these until the last
item on the agenda.

NOVOGEN SALES INCREASE AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ADVANCE

Australian pharmaceutical company, Novogen Limited, lifted sales for
the year to 30 June 2000, to \$23.4 million, an increase of 19 per
cent over the previous corresponding period.

Sales contributions were \$13.8 million from the United States and
Canada, \$7.9 million from Australia and New Zealand, and \$1.7 million
from Europe.

Operating loss after tax for the year ended 30 June 2000, was \$13.6
million. This is a 21 per cent improvement on the \$17.4 million loss
for the previous year.

Managing Director of Novogen, Mr Christopher Naughton, said
investment in research and drug clinical trials was increased to
accelerate the development of the Company
'
s intellectual property and
the pharmaceutical product opportunities arising from the
increasingly successful pre-clinical studies of compounds from the
Novogen product 
"
pipeline
"
.

The Company also continued to invest in the ongoing rollout world-wide
of the two natural red clover based dietary supplement products
Trinovin(TM) and Promensil(TM).

Highlights for the financial year were:

* Launch of the post-menopausal dietary supplement, Rimostil(TM) in
June 2000 into Australia and Canada; 
* Further trial data released on the positive effects of Promensil;
The entry of the anti-cancer compound NV-06 into human clinical
trials;
* The announcement of the successful clinical trial result for NV-06
for stability and tolerability in humans;
*Award of an Australian Government START Grant of \$3.7 million to
expedite the pre-clinical trials for the cardiovascular compound
NV-04;
* Completion of a pilot manufacturing plant to produce the NV
prescription drug series of compounds for world clinical studies;
* Elevation of Novogen securities into the NASDAQ National market;
and
* Novogen
'
s entry into the Australian ASX -200 Index.

Advances in the Company
'
s drug development and clinical programs
include the entry into human clinical trials of the anti-cancer
compound NV-06.

This process is a forerunner to lodging an application with the US
Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to commence human trialing in
America.

The Company believes the advances made in the development programs of
its other novel drugs NV-04 and NV-07, confirm their potential also
to enter into human clinical trials.

Mr Naughton said research advances had enabled the over-the-counter
product Rimostil be produced and launched initially on both the
Australian and Canadian markets


"
The establishment of Novogen operations in six countries will now
facilitate the further product roll out of Rimostil and our
subsequent over-the-counter products. Our first expansion phase
involving Promensil and Trinovin is complete and our subsidiary
infrastructure and third party contractors are in place and
operational,
"
 Mr Naughton said.


"
Our strategy is to consolidate further our position as an Australian
company developing and supplying consumer and prescription products
to a global market,
"
 Mr Naughton said.

Net assets at 30 June 2000 increased from \$48.2 million to \$52.7
million. Contributing to this was the June 2000 raising of \$17.9
million from a share issue to a number of international institutional
investors.

Novogen research continues to demonstrate that the over-the-counter
products based on standardised and specifically formulated
isoflavones have an important function in the maintenance of health
in both women and men. Their synthetic derivatives form the basis of
the NV series of phenolic hormones in the Novogen drug research and
clinical development programs and show the promise of focussed and
potent effects across a range of western disease conditions affecting
the aging population.

Product milestones announced during the year included:

*New Promensil study demonstrates significant reduction in hot flushes
during menopause - 9 September, 1999;
* Clinical evidence that Rimostil protects against bone and heart
disease in post-menopausal women - 24 September, 1999; 
* New Promensil study reveals breast disease benefit - 21 December,
1999;
* New milestone for NV-04 the cardiovascular drug - 31 January, 2000;
* New research strengthens expectations for Novogen
'
s NV-04
cardiovascular drug - 4 May, 2000;
* NV-06 anti-cancer drug passes its first clinical hurdle - 6 June
2000; Research on post-menopause sees Novogen launch Rimostil- 22
June, 2000;
* New study shows Promensil assists in the maintenance of bone
strength - 6 July 2000; and
* Novogen NV-06 anti-cancer drug trials advance plus completion of
the NV-06 infusion study - 21 August, 2000.

Novogen is involved in drug discovery and product development for
disorders that are commonly associated with hormone imbalance and
with ageing.

The Company co-ordinates an international clinical research and
development program with external collaborators, hospitals and
universities.

1999 FINANCIAL RESULTS

Novus Petroleum Limited (
"
Novus
"
), as required under Listing Rule
4.3, is releasing the 
"
Preliminary Final Report
"
 in respect of the
financial year ended 31 December 1999. The Report has been derived
from accounts that were approved and adopted by the Novus Board at a
meeting held today, Thursday 2 March 2000. A copy of these accounts,
which have been audited by the company
'
s auditors, is also being sent
to the Exchange. At the same meeting, the Directors recommended that
no dividend be paid in respect of the year ended 31 December 1999.

HIGHLIGHTS FOR 1999 COMPARED TO 1998:

* Operating profit up 187% to \$15.5 million

* End year reserves up 18% to 154 million barrels of oil equivalent
(
"
boe
"
), reflecting exploration and acquisition successes

* Annual production down 4.5% to 7.48 million boe, reflecting sale of
less profitable properties for reinvestment of capital into growth
projects

* EBITDA up 9% to \$68.5 million

* Cash flow (after allowing for movements in working capital at year
end) up 13% to \$51.8 million

* Effective tax rate down to 39% (from 75% in previous year)

* Net debt to total capital 42% (41% in 1998) despite heavy capital
expenditure on Egyptian gas development, Cooper acquisition and other
projects

Average realised oil price for the year was US\$17.48 per barrel, but
only US\$13.26 per barrel in the first half. The strong oil prices in
the second half of 1999 have increased further in 2000 to date. None
of Novus
'
 production is hedged.

DETAILS

The profit result for 1999 was \$15.5 million. This represents a 187%
increase in operating profit from the previous year
'
s level of \$5.4
million. This increase reflects the higher oil prices in 1999 as well
as the commencement of production from the Western Desert Gas Scheme
in Egypt and the acquisition of an interest in the Cooper Basin, both
in the 3rd quarter of 1999. Significantly, 78% (\$12.1 million) of the
1999 profit was earned in the second half of the year. 

In comparison to 1998, the profit result can be dissected as follows:

                                                 1999         1998 
                                               \$MILLION      \$MILLION 

Operating profit after tax but before
abnormal profit/exploration write-offs           15.5          5.4 

Abnormal profit on sale of petroleum 
interests (1998: sale of interest in 
South East Sumatra PSC and                          -         26.3 
Carnarvon Basin) 

Write-off of unsuccessful exploration 
expenditure                                         -        (45.3) 

Net profit after tax                             15.5        (13.6) 

The profit result was achieved on a sales revenue increase of 5%
reflecting:

* A significant improvement in oil prices with an average realised
oil price during 1999 of US\$17.48 per barrel which represents a 37%
increase over the 1998 average realised price of US\$12.77 per barrel.
Novus continues to be unhedged on oil prices and will therefore
continue to benefit from higher oil prices while they prevail.

* High grading of the portfolio during 1998 and 1999. In June 1998,
the Company
'
s interest in the South East Sumatra PSG was sold and in
November 1998, a portfolio of Carnarvon Basin assets (notably the
Harriet interest) was sold. As a consequence, these assets have not
contributed to revenues and profits during 1999. On the other hand,
the Company
'
s interests in a portfolio of concessions in Egypt were
acquired in June 1998, from which oil production has been derived
since that date and, in August 1999, gas production from the Western
Desert Gas Scheme in Egypt came on stream. The Company also acquired
a 4.75% interest in the Cooper Basin which has been accounted for
since August 1999.

* The resultant production for 1999 was 7.48 million boe which is a
0.35 million boe (4.5%) reduction from 1998.

Profit before interest, tax, depreciation/amortisation and
exploration write-offs (EBITDAX) has increased by 9% to \$68.5
million. The acquisition of the interest in the Cooper Basin has
assisted in lowering the Company
'
s effective tax rate from 75% in
1998 to 39% in 1999, as the profits from this asset can be offset by
otherwise unutilised allowances for tax.

The company continues to be a strong generator of operating cash
flow, generating \$41.5 million in 1999 (1998 - \$51.5 million).
Significantly the operating cash flow generated in the second half of
1999 was \$25.7 million compared with \$15.9 million in the first half,
an increase of 62%. The 1999 operating cash flow does not include a
\$10.3 million increase in working capital, primarily due to an
increase in receivables as at 31st December reflecting liftings late
in the year at the higher oil prices.

As a consequence of the acquisition of the interest in the Cooper
Basin, the level of net debt increased from \$128.5 million at the
start of 1999 to \$197.9 million by 31 December 1999. The Cooper Basin
acquisition was also partly funded through the issues of 48.5m
ordinary shares which raised \$72.3 million. The resultant ratio of
net debt to shareholders
'
 funds at 31 December 1999 is 74% compared
with 69% at the end of the prior year (equivalent to 42% and 41%
respectively in terms of debt:debt plus equity). Operating cash flow
before working capital movements for 1999 was 5.3 times the net
interest (1998 - 4.7 times).

Norwest Energy NL advises that following the successful setting of a
cement plug inside the 9-5/8
"
 casing, the well has been secured.
Operations to release the annular sections of the BOP are underway.
This will allow servicing the BOP and replacing the worn out rubber
elements. This task should take approximately three days to complete.

Coleraine 1 is being drilled updip and 12.5 kilometres west of the
Minotaur 1 well which is interpreted to have intersected a 7 metre
untested oil column in the Elang Formation and encountered
significant Oil saturation
'
s in the underlying Plover Formation. If
filled to spill point the prospect has the potential to contain 150
million barrels of oil recoverable.

During 1999 Phillips Oil Company farmed into ZOCA96-16 for the
drilling of Coleraine 1. Under terms of that agreement Norwest will
fund 5.714% of the drilling and if warranted, costs of the Coleraine
1 well to retain 14% interest in the PSC.

At Yandal Operations, Jundee gold production was the second highest
on record and cash cost the lowest achieved. The open pit mining rate
declined, reflecting an increase in hard, fresh ore as the pits
deepen, although compensated by higher grades. The main production
source was Nim 3 pit, with five other pits mined. Underground, Barton
Deeps continued to produce at a rate comparable to previous quarters.
Decline development continued towards Hughes and Nim 3 orebodies, the
next source of production. Mill throughput was lower with the
relatively hard feed. Recovery was maintained at 93.9 percent despite
the increasing proportion of fresh ore.

At Bronzewing, restricted Central Zone operations recommenced in
August. A mass blast of the Discovery Shoot crown pillar (approaching
400,000t) was completed and production commenced toward period end.
Ore stockpile replenishment commenced. McClure operations continued
normally.

At Wiluna, processing of stockpiled primary are (higher tonnage, but
lower grade) improved recoveries and unit costs as forecast. Pillar
recovery at Bulletin commences next quarter.

DEVELOPMENT

At Wiluna, the East-West Lode open pit project study is nearing
completion, with only final pit design detail outstanding. Additional
drilling is scheduled for the conceptual underground design

OAKTON COMPUTING LIMITED

CHAIRMAN

S ADDRESS (CONT
'
D)

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SALES

In our prospectus we committed to continuing to research and develop
opportunities to provide software products.

Oakton Computing has entered in to a worldwide exclusive distribution
agreement with the NSW Police for the sale of the e@gle.i
investigation management system to other customers. Plus we extended
our consulting relationship with the NSW Police, resulting in an
additional \$1 million in revenues to Oakton Computing for further
development of e@gle.i.

The NSW Police Service was delighted with the performance of e@gle.i
during the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The Queensland Police Service
also came online during the games period, using the ASP ready nature
of e@gle.i.

In October 2000, e@gle.i took first place in the Australian
Government Award category at the prestigious Australian Information
Industry Association
'
s 8th Annual iAwards.

BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT

In our prospectus we foreshadowed a desire to use our skills in
managing and placing IT professionals as the basis for a new related
business.

In line with our commitment, and to add further value for our clients
and our business, in August 2000 we established Oakton People, a
dynamic, service orientated, IT recruitment consultancy. Oakton
People offers a full range of IT recruitment services for contract
and permanent positions utilising the Internet and in-house
technologies, delivering effective outcomes to both clients and
candidates.

Oakton People provides us with significant competitive advantage and
increases the overall value of our services. It also represents a
major growth opportunity as the demand for highly skilled IT
professionals continues to rise.

Oakton People is making good progress as clients demonstrate openness
to a new supplier with excellent customer services and fresh ideas.

GROWTH BY ACQUISITION

In our prospectus we also foreshadowed that one of the key reasons
for our public fundraising was to enable the acquisition by Oakton
Computing of existing businesses.

In July 2000 we acquired Frontline Consulting, now known as Oakton
Solutions. This is giving us increased capabilities in the area of
Internet-enabled ERP, CRM and supply chain e-business solutions.
Oakton Solutions leverages the Oakton group
'
s network of technology
resources, as well as its management experience, to offer turn-key
Internet business solutions to enterprise organisations.

In October 2000, Oakton Computing made its most strategic acquisition
to date with the purchase of Charter Wilson, a premier IT strategy
and architecture consulting practise.

With emphasis on the strategy and architectural stages, Charter
Wilson builds a clear picture of the business strategy and business
objectives requiring technology support.

Charter Wilson also works with clients to develop comprehensive
business specifications, conduct technology selection processes and
manage delivery of their solutions.

The inclusion of Charter Wilson into the Oakton group will create
value in three key areas:

* It strengthens the Oakton group
'
s strategy consulting practice to
match its existing development and integration capabilities;

* It will enable the continued delivery of Charter Wilson
'
s vendor
independent strategy and architectural services as new service
offerings from both Oakton Computing and Oakton Solutions; plus

* It will provide the platform for the development of a new range of
services that combine the respective strategy, architecture and
delivery capabilities of each organisation. These new services will
also compliment and expand the existing Oakton group end-to-end
solution service offerings.

Charter Wilson will maintain its independence within the Oakton group
as an established and respected brand.

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

Our prospectus was predicated upon a public offering of shares in
Oakton Computing and a subsequent public listing.

We had a highly successful initial public offering, which closed over
subscribed and raised \$16.25 million.

We became a public company and listed on the Australian Stock
Exchange on 2nd June 2000 (ASX:OKN). Thus towards the end of the
1999/2000 fiscal year our business model entered a new phase. Since
then we
'
ve stepped up the pace of strategic investments, acquisitions
and related business development.

From a personal point of view, it has been a fascinating experience
to participate in the journey with Oakton Computing through the IPO
and listing process.

We were fortunate to assemble a highly credentialed team to assist us
in this and it was a pleasure to work with all parties involved.
Special thanks go to JB Were 
&
 Son, Minter Ellison and Pitcher
Partners for their expert assistance.

Certainly it was a learning experience for the incumbent management
of Oakton Computing, but an experience that has put them in good
stead to move forward. A simple example of this is that the design
and preparation for printing of the prospectus had to be outsourced.
However, it was done in a way that made it possible for the
compilation and layout of the annual report to be done internally at
a significant cost saving and, in my humble opinion, with a very
impressive result.

One of the features that makes private companies unique is the single
minded vision and focus of the principals. Sometimes in public
companies this gets lost in a sea of procedure and compliance issues.

In some large public companies lethargy sets in or at least a 
"
status
quo
"
 philosophy emerges. I can assure you that your Board and
management are committed to aligning employee rewards to its business
performance. We will continue to foster participation in our share
and options plans providing incentive to our people to deliver
benefits to all shareholders.

UNFASHIONABLE BEHAVIOUR

As you can see, Oakton Computing has delivered on the promises it
made to you. Something that seems to be not very fashionable
behaviour in recent times.

Oakton Computing proceeded with the IPO and public listing in the
midst of the technology stock wreck. Now we are pleased to table
annual financials results that exceed our prospectus forecasts. Not
very fashionable behaviour.

Your Board and management team continue to build a truly sound
business. We
'
ve successfully taken Oakton Computing into an exciting
growth and development era that we hope will propel our Company
forward as we continue to position our Company as an industry leader
and innovator. Oakton Computing delivers results, not over hyped
hopes. Not very fashionable behaviour.

Oakton Computing judiciously acquired two companies with the proceeds
of the IPO, and then replenished cash reserves from our positive cash
flow. Not very fashionable behaviour. 

Oakton Computing was one of the eight public Australian technology
companies that produced a positive cash flow result for the first
quarter of fiscal year 2000/2001, whilst the 103 other public
technology companies didn
'
t. Again, this is not very fashionable
behaviour.

Today our share price is trading around \$1.28. That
'
s a 28% increase
in less than 6 months, representing \$20.7 million of value for all
shareholders. Not very fashionable behaviour in an environment where
most other Australian technology companies are suffering the trauma
of watching shareholder value erode.

I guess I
'
m really saying that if being unfashionable is what it
takes to deliver the positive results we can all benefit from, then
your Board and your management are prepared to continue, to be
unfashionable on your behalf.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Our cornerstone shareholders, Paul Holyoake and Tim Norton, continue
to maintain their strong commitment to Oakton Computing.
Notwithstanding their significant shareholdings, your Company adheres
to its strict Corporate Governance policies and procedures to ensure
that all shareholders
'
 interests are considered equally.

I am pleased to announce that our auditors, Pitcher Partners, and our
lawyers, Minter Ellison, have established effective working
relationships with the board and management team, and that they are
more than happy to continue to work with us. 

As shareholders, you will have received a full Annual Report with
your Notice of Meeting. In future years we hope to enable you to
elect to receive a concise Annual Report, or the full Annual Report
in electronic form. We hope this will translate in to significant
savings for your Company and our environment.

We welcome your feedback on our Annual Report, and on our reporting
generally.

LOOKING FORWARD

I will now turn to those matters before us in fiscal year 2000/2001.
There are a number of exciting opportunities for our Company
presently emerging.

We will continue to grow our core businesses as we work towards our
goal of becoming the leading provider of enterprise-class,
end-to-end, Business Internet solutions and the preferred IT partner
of medium, large and enterprise sized organisations. This is the
cornerstone of our success.

The unstoppable power of the Internet is creating unprecedented
opportunities across every industry. Companies of all sizes are
realising that they must leverage the Internet in order to remain
competitive in the new Business Internet economy. They are
discovering that the creation and implementation of successful
Business Internet models requires specialised knowledge, unique
experience and deep resources.

To obtain these capabilities, increasing numbers of leading companies
are turning to the Oakton group for end to end Business Internet
solutions. As a market leader, we are committed to transforming these
opportunities into value for our shareholders. 

We will also seek out opportunities to take advantage of the evolving
Business Internet and web services markets for our own business. New
technologies will create huge opportunities over the next few years.

For example, Oakton Solutions is positioned to become a leading
next-generation Application Service Provider, that manages and
operates fully integrated, subscription-based electronic commerce,
enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management
(CRM) and supply-chain applications. However, your Board is well
aware that the application service provider (ASP) market is quite
likely to play out in much the same way as the early Internet
business to consumer commerce market. That is, a high percentage of
failures and few sound business models. We
'
ll continue to be
unfashionable and look for profitable application service provider
(ASP) opportunities.

As other technologies such as wireless and mobile devices
proliferate, we will expand our investments and alliances. We
'
ll
continue to help our clients to profit from the use of such new
technologies, plus look for profitable business opportunities of our
own.

Our strategic initiatives for the remainder of the 2000/2001 fiscal
year include substantial investments in infrastructure and highly
skilled Internet professionals to ensure we expand our high-level
consulting skills-base and further enhance our ability to deliver
robust Business Internet solutions.

We will continue to pursue organic growth, hiring top professionals
and providing a stimulating and challenging work environment to
ensure that the Oakton group remain a great place to build a career.
We will also maintain our successful programme of graduate recruitment
and staff training and development. This is vital for our future in
an environment where the IT skills shortage is rapidly increasing.

We will continue to make strategic, complementary acquisitions to
further expand our client base, increase our technical and sales
resources, and achieve demonstrable economies of scale. Plus we will
continue to support the establishment of new business initiatives,
such as Oakton People and Oakton Venture Partners.

Our goal is to continue to anticipate the next generation of client
expectations and deliver visionary, technologically advanced
solutions. We have elected to invest so as to fully leverage our
early successes and market validation in a number of key areas. It
requires that we make a level of investment that exceeds what we
'
ve
done to date, but it will allow us to continue on an agenda of
aggressive goals and major initiatives for fiscal year 2000/2001,
while positioning us to maintain our excellent bottom-line
performance in future years.

From the beginning, we had a consistent vision of where our clients
would need to be and how we could best help them to get there. We
have worked hard to become the partner our clients need for the
Business Internet age - a partner that sees and understands the
Business Internet universe in its entirety, a partner that
incorporates the skills and services needed for designing, building
and delivering end-to-end Business Internet solutions. 

Oakton Computing occupies a position of strength in a market that is
growing at a healthy rate. We are committed to lead the market with
constant innovation, delivering on a technology vision shaped by a
perspective on the opportunity that has been sharpened through
discourse with Oakton Computing
'
s stakeholders - be they clients,
partners, investors or employees.

While it would be improper to predict future earnings and dividends,
your Board is confident that shareholders will find our growth
aspirations more than satisfactory.

With great pride, we look back on Oakton Computing
'
s success in
fiscal year 1999/2000. We are grateful to all of our employees for
making this possible at Internet speed.

Oakton has harnessed the power of the Internet and transformed its
energy into an engine of value to our shareholders and clients.
Whilst one of Oakton Computing
'
s strengths is that it recognises and
remains committed to a proven underlying core business, it is equally
true that Oakton Computing is a different business today from what it
was one year ago - it may well be a different business again one
year from now. We are pleased that you are with us on this journey.

CLOSING

I would now like to hand over to Tim Norton, Joint Managing Director
and Co-founder of Oakton Computing.

Tim will provide you with:

* more details on the operation and performance of the Company for
the 1999/2000 fiscal year;

* an update on the current position and structure of the Company;
plus

* a strategic snapshot of where we
'
re heading for fiscal year
2000/2001
and beyond

) wishes to advise that agreement
has been reached between the joint venture participants in the
Kutubu, Gobe Main, Moran and Hides oil and gas fields on the terms on
which gas reserves will be dedicated to the PNG-QLD Gas Project.

A binding Heads of Agreement (
"
HOA
"
) has been prepared which provides
for gas volumes of up to 600 million standard cubic feet per day to
be available for sale to the Queensland market for a period of thirty
years. It is intended that this document will be superceded by a
detailed Agreement at or around the time of Financial Close of the
Project.

The agreement of terms for a cooperative development of the Kutubu,
Gobe Moran and Hides gas fields represents a major milestone for the
PNG-QLD Gas Project. It follows Comalco
'
s recent announcement that
subject to final feasibility, it has selected Gladstone as the
preferred site for a proposed new alumina refinery, and paves the way
for Gas Sales Agreements to be concluded with a range of customers,
including Comalco, involved in power generation and general industry
in Queensland.

Orogen currently owns approximately 13% of the PNG-QLD Gas Project
and has the right but not the obligation to increase its interest in
the project to up to 23% by acquiring equity in the Hides Gas field
under the terms of its Option Agreement with the State of Papua New
Guinea.

With such a significant interest in the PNG-QLD Gas Project, Orogen
is a major beneficiary of the agreement that has been reached by the
various field participants. Orogen is now looking forward to
continuing to work with its partners in the PNG-QLD Gas Project to
complete all tasks that remain to achieve Financial Close of the
Project as soon as possible.

SHOP
Brisbane
On behalf of 131 Shop.com.au Limited
'
s Board of Directors, I am
pleased to present the half-year results.

In what was an exciting six-months for the Company, we successfully
listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, expanded nationally our
business model from the successful pilot in South-East Queensland
and, more recently, have launched a number of significant initiatives
that will expand the 131 Shop business.

For the six-month reporting period to 31st December 2000, 131 Shop
produced revenues of \$3.6 million. Net losses for the same period were
\$3.3 million including an abnormal expense of \$600,000 from the
reacquisition of its Sydney, Perth and Melbourne dealerships.

Since reacquisition, the Company has focused its efforts on
developing sales and distribution channels to replace the previous
dealerships and on the launch of the e-Business Starter Kit. These
channels include the Company
'
s own corporate sales team and a number
of strategic distributors who replace the large number of sales
representatives employed by the previous Sydney, Perth and Melbourne
dealerships.

The Company has entered into an arrangement with an international
sales and telemarketing organisation, that has a highly successful
track record with a number of Top 100 Australian companies, to
commence a 4 week sales campaign of the e-Business Starter Kit with
remuneration based on a success fee. This trial alone is expected to
generate significant revenue. After the successful completion of the
trial, a comprehensive campaign will then follow.

The Company is in negotiations with a number of groups for the
commissioning of e-commerce portals. Significant revenue is also
expected to be generated from these current projects.

Finally, the Company has signed up a number of retail distributors
who will sell the e-Business Starter Kit.

With the success of this multi-channel sales and distribution
operation and the e-Business Starter Kit, the Directors are
confident of achieving results at least equivalent to the Prospectus
performance forecasts for the full-year to 30th June 2000. 

I would like to take this opportunity to outline three further 
initiatives: 

Overseas Licences - a major development for 131 Shop has been the
potential to take our business model to the world. As previously
announced, we are within weeks of commencing the first stage of our
pilot project in the United States. This pilot will act as a model
from which potential licensees for other US cities will assess. The
licensees will purchase an exclusive e-commerce and Internet
marketing technology licence for each city, paying a one-off fee plus
a significant ongoing revenue stream. Furthermore, we are negotiating
the sale of the New Zealand licence with a local consortium and are
involved in discussions with a number of parties with respect to
license agreements in Asia.

e-Business Starter Kit - 131 Shop has launched its e-Business Starter
Kit. This package has been developed specifically to enable small and
medium size businesses an efficient and inexpensive entree to the
new-age of e-commerce. The e-Business Starter Kit has a number of
attractive features. It contains an Internet marketing package
(comprising banner ads, marketing e-mail facilities and many other
features designed to assist businesses to promote their e-commerce
site) as well as an e-commerce solution that allows Business to
Business and Business to Consumer transactions. The e-Business
Starter Kit has been competitively priced at \$499 for the first year.

The Stream Team Pty Ltd (ACN 090 724 584) - 131 Shop is pleased to
announce the appointment of Mr Austin Kelly, former CEO of MOJO
Australia, as a consultant to The Stream Team Pty Ltd, our Internet
advertising business and wholly owned subsidiary. The Directors
welcome the experience and knowledge he brings to the Team.

The Stream Team develops cutting-edge technology that produces
multimedia Internet advertisements (containing video, audio and
e-commerce facilities) for clients sourced from the thousands of 131
Shop business subscribers throughout Australia. 131 Shop intends that
The Stream Team will also sell Internet advertising to subscribers of
our international licensees.

SHOP

131SHOP.COM.AU LIMITED - COMPANY PROGRESS AND CASH POSITION

The Directors of 131SHOP are pleased with the Company
'
s progress
over the last three months. During this time, the Company has:

* Restructured the direct sales operation as a result of terminating
the dealership of Telenet Corporation, the company that held the 
131SHOP Sales dealerships in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. During the
period of this restructure, revenue from direct sales was
significantly less than previously expected.

* Developed and launched the 
'
e-Business Starter Kit
'
, a cost
effective e-commerce and internet marketing product aimed at SME
'
s.
This product has been developed to replace the majority of the direct
sales force and allow the remaining elite direct sales team to focus
on corporate sales.

* Implemented a strategy to outsource telemarketing sales of the 
'
e-
Business Starter Kit
'
 on a risk share basis with one of Australia
'
s
leading direct sales companies.

* Concluded an agreement with Bartercard Limited to sub-licence the
Company
'
s shopping mall technology to enable Bartercard to technology
enable their 30,000 members. 131SHOP will receive a licence fee for
all Bartercard members that join the Bartercard Shopping Mall. It is
projected that 131SHOP will generate \$4.25million per annum in
licence fee income if at least one third of Bartercard members join.

* In addition to the Bartercard sub-licence, the Directors have
negotiated a priority allocation for existing 131SHOP shareholders
in the upcoming Bartercard Limited Initial Public Offering. Further
details of this offer will be announced to shareholders shortly.

* Won a tender from Tourism Queensland for the development of an
Internet User Guide aimed at assisting small tourism operators
successfully promote their business in the Internet. This tender was
won in conjunction with Leisure Solutions Pty Ltd.

* Tendered for the development of a number of e-commerce portals, 
including one tender in conjunction with Unisys and Microsoft.

During this same period, the company incurred the following one-off
expenses:

* As a result on the termination of Telenet Corporation and the
Company
'
s desire to keep the Telenet sales staff in place while the
sales organisation was restructured, the Company absorbed a number of
staff and office costs that have now been significantly reduced or
eliminated.

* The development of the 
'
e-Business Starter Kit
'
 product, which was
released in March 2000, involved software development and marketing
material.

It should also be noted that at the end of March 2000, the Company
had a total of \$2,046,835 in pre-payments which are not reflected in
the cash position and consist of pre-paid advertising, software
development, IT support and marketing costs relating to the
e-business starter kit. The Company also has a number of customers on
monthly payment schemes. The value of these trade debtors exceeds
\$300,000.

As part of the company
'
s future management structure, the Directors
have identified a role for a full time CEO and will shortly instigate
a search for likely candidates. In the interim, Mr Trevor Gardiner,
Executive Director has taken on the role of acting CEO.

making a written takeover offer to all Otter shareholders. The
regulatory timetable for a written offer will allow the Board of
Otter time to respond to any such offer and will also require the
preparation of an independent Appraisal Report by Otter.

The GPG interests have also agreed to withdraw all legal actions
against Otter and its directors and also to withdraw the requisition
for a meeting of shareholders to consider removal of directors and
the appointment of GPG nominees.

Tony Frankham will continue as chairman of the company and the
Special Meeting of shareholders scheduled for 9 March will now not be
held.

Oxiana Resources advises results of first drilling from the Bankable
Feasibility Study at its 80% owned Sepon copper and gold Project. The
results from two of the holes include 63.7 m @ 4.78% copper from the
Khanong copper deposit and 30.8 m @ 4.72 g/t gold from the Nalou gold
deposit.

THE SEPON PROJECT

Oxiana Resources purchased 80% of the Sepon copper-gold project in
south-eastern Laos from Rio Tinto in August 2000. Rio Tinto remains a
20% shareholder in the Project. As reported in the 17 April 2000
release, Indicated and Inferred resource estimates for the near
surface Sepon deposits include 41.4 mt @ 2.4% copper at the Khanong
copper deposit and 34.7 mt @ 2.5 g/t gold (using a 1.0 g/t Au
cut-off) in three separate and adjacent gold deposits - Nalou,
Discovery and Namkok. A fourth adjacent gold deposit, Discovery West,
requires further drilling. Substantial additional gold and copper
resource potential has been identified.

DRILLING RESULTS

To date 7 holes for 343 metres of core drilling have been completed
over the Khanong copper and Nalou gold resources to obtain samples
for metallurgical testwork. Preliminary assay results of these holes
are:

*  0.5% Cu and 0.5 g/t Au cut-offs.

** Weighted averages of samples from 1 m intervals of split drillcore.


The Khanong drill holes are shown on Figure 1 and Nalou drill holes
on Figure 2.

These results confirm earlier work by Rio Tinto and demonstrate the
high grade nature of the deposits and robust economic potential.
Further results are expected during November.

BANKABLE FEASIBILITY STUDY (BFS)

The BFS commenced in August 2000 and includes:

* in-fill, metallurgical, geotechnical and sterilisation drilling

* laboratory and pilot-scale metallurgical test work

* geotechnical and mine planning studies

* environmental impact assessment

* engineering and capital and operating cost estimates

The BFS for gold development is scheduled for completion in mid 2001
with the copper BFS six months later. The Project is proposed to be
developed as gold Stage I and copper Stage II with cashflow from
early gold production contributing significantly to the copper
project funding. First gold production is presently scheduled for mid
2002.

PIMA MINING NL
Sydney
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

SAMAG LTD (80% Pima)

SOUTH AUSTRALIAN MAGNESIUM METAL PROJECT

TECHNOLOGY AND PERSONNEL

* SAMAG successfully concluded agreements for the exclusive licencing
of Dow
'
s Magnesium Technology. This was reported to the Australian
Stock Exchange Ltd on 24 January 2000. Mr Frank Petitti, previously
Global Business Director of Dow Magnesium has joined the SAMAG board
as a non-executive Director and consultant to assist in business and
marketing strategy.

* Ken Claus and Ed Skach, who have a combined 58 years experience at
Dow Magnesium, joined SAMAG to provide assistance in the plant
design, technology transfer, plant construction and commissioning and
the training of local operators.

* The process of transferring the Dow technology is well advanced.

SITE

* Several alternative plant sites have been examined in the Northern
Spencer Gulf of South Australia and in NSW and Victoria. SAMAG is
committed to establishing the plant where the long-term, total
capital and operating costs, are the lowest.

RESOURCE AND MINING

* Discussions have been held with relevant State Government
departments in order to finalise level of State encouragement and/or
imposts.

* Discussions continued with mining contractors regarding lowest cost
mining techniques and the establishment of a small pit to obtain a
bulk sample of ore for simulated plant leaching conditions.

* An economic evaluation of Magnesite Deposits in the Northern
Flinders Ranges was undertaken and a comprehensive report compiled.
Two deposits, Witchelina and Mt Hutton have been examined in detail
for potential development of a mining operation. Mt Hutton offers
low-calcium ore and a shorter haulage distance to the Telford rail
siding and has been selected for the first stage development of
mining operations.

* A comprehensive report on all activities and results of drilling
within EL 2100 prepared and released to BHP Minerals Ltd and Dept of
Primary Industries and Resources.

* A proposal to mine magnesite ore at Mt Hutton, Leigh Creek, was
prepared for submission to the Dept of Primary Industries and
Resources.

GAS AND ELECTRICITY

* SAMAG
'
s strategy on electricity supply is to encourage or promote
the establishment of an adjacent electricity generator for which
SAMAG would provide a base load of 130 MW capacity.

* Preliminary economic evaluations of a combined cycle gas turbine
power station together with the interruptibility benefits of the Dow
cell and heat recovery from an adjacent power station will result in
electricity costs below the levels assumed in the Definitive
Feasibility Study.

* The possibility of a gas pipeline being constructed to connect the
Victorian gas fields to Adelaide, which will create both additional
security of supply in the South Australian market as well as price
competition, would reduce electricity costs in South Australia. If
this occurred, the likelihood of SAMAG locating in the Northern
Spencer Gulf region is increased.

ENGINEERING

* Expressions of Interests were called for design engineering to an
appropriate level suitable for securing finance for the project. A
short list has been selected and more detailed negotiations are
expected to be finalised in the next quarter.

* Expressions of Interests have also been called for potential
construction contractors to work as part of a construction alliance
with the design engineer and SAMAG. A short list has been selected
and contract terms are to be negotiated and likely to be finalised
over the next quarter.

OFFTAKE ARRANGEMENTS

* Discussions were ongoing with various North American and Japanese
automotive industry participants and metal traders. Directors are
confident that a suitable offtake arrangements will be secured in
2000.

* International Magnesium Association reported that for the 9 months
to September 30, 1999 primary magnesium shipments for automotive
die-casting purposes increased by 26% to 97,500 tonnes.

INDUSTRY INVESTORS AND PARTNERS

* Discussion have been held with a number of major aluminium,
resource and trading groups with a view to them participating in the
project
'
s ownership and/or offtake. Several groups have entered into
confidentiality agreements and expressed interest participating in
the project. These discussions and negotiations are expected to be
ongoing until conclusion.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

The Joint Venture between Pima Mining and RASP Resources NL with
respect to EL
'
s 2320, 2323, 2330, 2322 and 2417 has been terminated.
A final report for each tenement has been prepared for the tenement
holder and the Department of Primary Industries and Resources.

The Joint Venture between Pima and Reynolds and Le Brun with respect

  James Allender             18% 
  A G F Le Brun              18% 
  I P Youles                  4%

TORRENS (EL 2533)

No fieldwork was undertaken on this tenement.

As announced to the Australian Stock Exchange on 13 January 2000, the
company has entered into a farm-out agreement with Billiton
Exploration Australia Pty Ltd and Minotaur Gold NL with respect to EL
2533.

Under the terms of the farm-in arrangement, Billiton/Minotaur may
expend \$750,000 to earn 75% equity in EL 2533 within 24 months of the
granting of drilling approvals. Billiton/Minotaur may expend an
additional \$1,250,000 to earn an additional 15% within a further 24
months. Kelaray may elect to dilute to a 2% free carried interest to
the end of a bankable feasibility study.

The Board of Pima Mining NL believes that this joint venture
agreement with Billiton and Minotaur will provide shareholders with
an opportunity to share in the development potential of this exciting
prospect at no cost to Pima Shareholders.

OTHER TENEMENTS

No field activities have been carried out on any of the other
tenements held by Pima Mining NL.

PASMINCO LIMITED
Melbourne
Pasminco announced today that it had temporarily closed a refinery
column at its Cockle Creek smelter to allow repairs following the
discovery of a leakage of zinc from the top section of the column.

The leak was discovered the week prior to Christmas however attempts
to stop the leak were unsuccessful. As a result of this repair,
refinery output will be limited to approximately 50% - 140 tonnes per
day - of refined metal capacity until an alternative column can be
brought on- line in about three weeks. Impact on production will be
minimal with the shortfall expected to be recovered during the next
two months.

The refinery is expected to return to full capacity by 23 January.

Arrangements have been made to ensure customers receive a continuous
supply of metal while repairs are completed.

\$140 million of equity (at \$1 per share). In addition a further \$340
million of equity was raised from various institutions (at \$1.50 per
share). PBL
'
s fully diluted share of One.Tel is now 17.4% with an
average entry price of \$0.81. 

* Acxiom

The Acxiom joint venture, established with Acxiom Corporation of the
USA, commenced business in October 1999. The early marketplace
interest in this customer relationship management services business
is strong.

* Wizard

Since the acquisition by PBL and ecorp of a combined 50% interest in
August 1999, this financial services business has experienced strong
growth in its customer acquisition rate, and in the size of its loan
book.

* Foxtel

Foxtel continues to grow both its cable and satellite businesses and
now has in excess of 635,000 subscribers. PBL has included an after
tax, equity accounted loss of \$12.8 million for the twelve months.

* Fox Sports

In October 1999 PBL acquired a 50% interest in Fox Sports, a supplier
of Sports channels to Australia
'
s leading Pay TV distributors, Foxtel
and Austar, for \$69 million. The business continues to grow strongly.

* Sky News Australia

This Australian Pay TV news channel, in which PBL has a one third
interest, supplies product to Foxtel, Optus and recently Austar, and
is trading profitably.

NET DEBT / CASH FLOW

During the twelve months ended 30 June 2000 the PBL group generated
\$450 million of net operating cash flow compared with \$216 million in
the prior year. The significant increase reflects a strong
contribution from Television Division and the inclusion of Crown for
the first time. After capital expenditure in the core divisions the
Group retained \$384M of the cash generated, compared with \$194M in
the prior year.

Despite the strong cash generated by its core businesses, net debt
increased to \$1,756 million at 30 June 2000, compared with \$1,564
million at 30 June 1999, and was impacted by major non-operating
outflows during Fiscal 2000 including:

* the acquisition of a 50% interest in Fox Sports 
* funding provided for growth oriented investments such as Foxtel, 
  Ninemsn, ebay, Acxiom etc 
* exercising \$140 million in One.Tel options 
* investments in Ticketek, TMS, Wizard and the Park Street Building 
  acquisition 
* the cash outflows associated with establishing new debt facilities 
  in completing the Crown acquisition and in rationalising the cost 
  base of Crown.

While debt levels have increased the Group
'
s interest coverage and
leverage ratios remain robust. 

During Fiscal 2000 PBL issued \$300 million of perpetual subordinated 
debt, \$500 million of seven year debt into the Euromarket and \$400 
million of long term debt under its domestic MTN program.

DIVIDEND

The directors announced a dividend on ordinary shares of 10 cents per
share payable 15 November 2000, to shareholders registered on the
books close at 5.00pm on 31 October 2000.

OUTLOOK

In commenting, Mr Nick Falloon, PBL
'
s CEO said:


"
Fiscal 2000 was a year of consolidation for PBL with the successful
integration of Crown into the Group, a strong contribution from
Television and Magazines, solid growth from the start up businesses
within ecorp, and further investment into the fast growing Pay TV and
Telecommunication businesses. Fiscal 2001 should see an improvement
on the strong earnings and cash flow performance delivered in Fiscal
2000.

Nine Network has started the new year strongly with a buoyant
advertising market largely mitigating the impact from lost revenue
share during the Sydney Olympic games. With costs firmly under
control, first quarter earnings should approximate the results for
the corresponding period last year. The Nine Networks schedule is as
strong as ever, and with a number of new shows to be launched, is
well positioned to maintain its clear leadership position post the
Olympics. The network will commence digital transmission on January
1, 2001 and is currently reviewing plans to fully exploit the
benefits of this exciting new development for the industry. The
division will launch two hours of Hindi programming on the
Doordarshan network in September and, with its joint venture partner
(Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd) continues to explore
opportunities in the broader Indian television market, which
continues to grow quickly.

ACP will continue to seek avenues for revenue growth primarily
through brand extension opportunities. During Fiscal 2001 this
division
'
s circulation revenue may be impacted by the recent
introduction of GST, and while initiatives underway will further
lower costs and improve operating efficiencies, a continued weak
Australian dollar will have an adverse impact on paper prices.

Crown is positioned to deliver double digit growth at the EBITDA
level (assuming theoretical win rate from VIP Program Play patrons
for both years), with new 
'
product
'
 initiatives expected to increase
revenue, combined with enhanced operating efficiencies and cost
reductions through the Building For Growth initiatives.

PBL
'
s three core businesses generate strong free cash flow and over
the past few years the Group has invested into new businesses which
have demonstrated strong growth as they build toward critical mass.
Collectively, these new businesses will require additional funding in
Fiscal 2001, however their cash demands on PBL are expected to
decrease over time. PBL
'
s 80% owned subsidiary ecorp has
approximately \$100 million of cash available to fund its future
growth. With our strong free cash flow, our depth of 
'
content
'
 and
our investments in high growth areas we are well positioned to take
advantage of a converging world.

AURIDIAM CONSOLIDATED NL
Perth
Auridiam Consolidated NL (
"
Auridiam
"
) is pleased to announce that its
75% owned subsidiary, Woodlark Mining Limited (
"
Woodlark
"
) has now
finalised and signed an Option Agreement with Misima Mines Limited
(
"
Misima
"
) (a subsidiary in the Placer Dome group of companies) which
will allow Misima to focus on the potential development of the
Woodlark Island Gold Project.

This Option Agreement is based on the previously announced Heads of
Agreement with Misima and sets a framework, based on specified
milestones and timetables, for exploration and feasibility studies to
occur, so as to culminate in a decision to mine.

Misima is strategically positioned to advance this project as it
owns and operates a significant gold mine on the nearby Misima Island
and Woodlark believes it may well be economically viable to barge ore
from Woodlark to Misima. Misima has a proven track record in
identifying and developing large gold deposits, is a highly regarded
professional miner and has excellent infrastructure and experience in
the area.

Should Misima exercise its option over the Woodlark licences it will
acquire 100% of the project for which Woodside will receive in
consideration a gross royalty of 4.5% until the first 200,000 ozs of
gold have been mined and 3.5% of all gold, or any other product
mined, thereafter.

Auridiam is a mining and exploration company with diamond interests
in Botswana and in North West Australia. It also has interests in
industrial engineering operations in major cities around Australia.

REVISED RESERVES AND RESOURCES

A new reserve and resource estimate has been calculated as at 30 June
2000 using a geological model that has been revised and enhanced
since the December 1999 statement.

Proved and probable reserves are now estimated at 95.9 million
tonnes at 3.2 grams of gold per tonne containing 9.8 million ounces
of gold compared with 103.4 million tonnes at 3.2 grams per tonnne
containing 10.7 million ounces in December 1999. The reserve estimate
is calculated at \$US325/oz gold price (using an exchange rate of 0.3
kina per \$US) and zero profit cut-off.

In addition to depletion by mining, the reserves have decreased by
4.6 million tonnes (approx 370,000oz) as a result of the exclusion of
high strip material from a modified pit design.

The information in the above tables was compiled by a Competent
Person, as defined by the Australasian Code for Reporting Identified
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. The Competent Person is Michael
Johnston who is a corporate member of the AusIMM and is employed as
Technical Services Manager by the Porgera Joint Venture.

Total measured and indicated mineral resources at a cut-off grade of
1.0 gram per tonne are 161.1 million tonnes at 2.7 grams per tonne
containing 13.9 million ounces of gold. This compares with 166.4
million tonnes at 2.7 grams per tonne containing 14.5 million ounces
in December 1999. The measured and indicated resources include proved
and probable reserves.

An additional 14.5 million tonnes of inferred resources were
estimated at 3.2 grams of gold per tonne. These inferred resources
contain 3.5 million tonnes at 7.5 grams per tonne (0.85 million
ounces of gold) of underground resources. The Joint Venture is
confident that, following finalisation of mine design and planning,
some of these underground resources will be upgraded to reserve
status by the end of this year.

Exploration continues to find additional ore-bearing intersections in
the Footwall Diorite Zone. Ore that is accessible from development of
the de-watering tunnel has been delineated in the Eastern Deeps.

Relations with the Porgera community remain excellent and the
development of Paiam town is proceeding well with the first group of
new houses in Paiam being occupied. A construction contract for an
additional 55 houses is about to be let.

The ongoing program of community engagement along the river system
downstream of the project is being well received and several health
project are being implemented together with the World Health
Organization (WHO) in the Nomad and Lake Murray areas.

The annual environmental monitoring and sustainability reports were
completed.

CHAIRMAN
'
S ADDRESS

The following are the Addresses given by the Chairman of Pacific
Dunlop, Mr John Ralph and by the Managing Director, Mr Rod Chadwick
at the Company
'
s Annual General Meeting in Melbourne today.

Pacific Dunlop is undergoing a complete make-over. At last year
'
s
annual meeting I talked about the nature of the reorganization that
Pacific Dunlop needed, and why it was necessary.

On 3rd July this year I wrote to shareholders to provide you with a
progress report on a number of important steps upon which we had
embarked to strengthen the fundamental position of the Company. Each
of these steps was part of an integrated strategy to restore health
to the Company and set in place a foundation on which we could build.
Three major changes that were under way at the time I wrote to you
have progressed to completion; the sale of the GNB Technologies
business, the sale of the Electrical Distribution business and the
implementation of the Novare shared services joint venture with
Andersen Consulting.

The details of the share buy-back, that was also foreshadowed in my
letter have since been announced and we expect to complete that
transaction on 10th November

I would like to comment on each of these transactions and, in
particular, to give you an appreciation of the rationale for
undertaking them, before moving on to what is ahead of the company
and our approach to establishing a path to more profitable growth.

The GNB Technologies automotive battery business was in an industry
that had excess capacity, had largely given up brand equity to the
retailers in the USA, and needed to be rationalized and consolidated
before a reasonable return on investment was likely to be earned.
Because the industrial battery business did not suffer from the same
drawbacks it was in a sounder condition but it was a smaller part of
the business. The battery manufacturing business is also one that
requires continuing capital investment, particularly in the
environmental area, despite the low returns that were being achieved.

For this reason, a decision was taken to dispose of our investment in
this business. Unfortunately, this took much longer to accomplish
than we would have liked. As shareholders are aware, the first sale
agreement lapsed when the buyer was unable to complete the
transaction after a lengthy delay in meeting the competition
regulatory requirements. This was the only prospective buyer we were
able to interest at that time despite canvassing the market very
widely.

The opportunity to re-open discussions occurred in the latter part of
last year and this led to the sale of the business to Exide
Corporation, which was completed on 30th September last. This
transaction has made Exide the leading company in the stored energy
solutions industry. There are considerable synergies to be extracted
from putting the two businesses together and Pacific Dunlop has 4
million Exide shares as part of the consideration for the
transaction.

At a strategy review earlier this year we decided to offer the
Electrical Distribution for sale because we felt that we were likely
to be able to achieve more value for shareholders than continuing to
operate the business ourselves. The market was divided more or less
equally between three companies. Profit margins were low and there
was almost no opportunity for growth in domestic market share. The
other two companies were large international groups that had recently
entered the Australian market by way of acquisition. They had large
international operations in the industry and, therefore, scale in
systems and purchasing.

We were able to complete the sale of the business to the Hagemeyer
Group in August on a very satisfactory basis and realize a value
greater than had we retained and continued to operate the business.

The sale of these two businesses released over \$900 million cash
which has enabled the company to pay down debt and to institute the
off-market tender buy-back of approximately 10% of the shares
outstanding. The reason for buying back shares off-market is to
complete the purchase in a short time frame, to provide greater
certainty that the buy-back will be completed and, an important
consideration as far as the Company was concerned, was to give all
shareholders who wished to participate, equal opportunity to do so.

Shareholders will be asked later in the meeting to give their
approval to a resolution giving the Company power to buy-back up to
another 10% of the shares currently on issue. There are no plans for
the Company to make use of this power but it is considered desirable
to have the flexibility to go beyond the 10% authority being absorbed
by the off-market buy-back, should an appropriate opportunity arise
before the next Annual General Meeting. 

The other initiative which has been brought to fruition since my
letter of 3rd July is the implementation of the Novare Joint Venture
with Andersen Consulting.

This is an important venture for the Company and there are three
principal benefits to be derived. The first is a reduction in
overhead costs that will flow from the arrangement that has been
negotiated.

The second, which is of considerable strategic significance, relates
to the ability to be at the leading edge in relation to processes and
systems at a cost which is affordable. This is vital for companies
wishing to participate in the e-commerce channel to market. Critical
to success in this regard are systems and fulfillment. Mr Chadwick
will be referring to this in his presentation to you shortly. The
only practicable way to do this for many companies, including many
larger than Pacific Dunlop, will be through alliances where costs can
be shared and where there is access to global intellectual property.
This is what the joint venture with Andersen Consulting brings.

The third advantage is also strategic. The outsourcing aspect of the
venture which puts the management of administrative functions in the
hands of those who can specialise in this area will allow Pacific
Dunlop management to focus on those things that are critical to the
competitive success of the business in a fast changing world.

I can report that considerable progress has been made in the last
year in re-positioning the Pacific Brands and Pacific Automotive
businesses. They will be operating on a common supply chain platform
that will reduce costs and improve margins through greater
integration of supply chain management. These changes are essential
to position the Company to participate effectively in the e-commerce
channel to market, while continuing to service customers through the
more traditional channels.

The changes necessary to respond to the different environment in
which the Company now operates has presented a very significant
challenge. The former structure of many separate, largely autonomous,
units, each with its own overheads was entirely appropriate in a
world of high tariff protection and quotas but this structure would
not be viable in the current environment. This has required
considerable rationalisation and consolidation of manufacturing and
warehousing and this is continuing.

The Company is also withdrawing from low value added manufacturing,
replacing this, where appropriate, with outsourcing but retaining
control of the brands, design, quality standards and intellectual
property.

These businesses are now well positioned to add bolt-on acquisitions.
Pacific Brands has added to its stable of brands during the last
year. In Pacific Automotive, the joint venture with Atkins Carlyle
was implemented and a national distribution agreement with Federal
Mogul of the USA was put in place. We see further opportunities of
this nature where the investment demands are modest and scale can be
added without a proportionate increase in operating costs.

Ansell had a somewhat disappointing year, principally because prices
in the European markets could not be adjusted sufficiently to
compensate for the substantial fall in the Euro against the US
dollar, and the compression in margins for examination gloves because
of world over-capacity. Notwithstanding these factors which affected
the whole industry, Ansell retains its strong position in the market,
being number one or two in each of the markets in which it operates.
Ansell has a strong technological underpinning, demonstrated by the
recent development of the Hyflex glove which combines the sewing and
dipping expertise within the company. This has resulted in a product
that has had the fastest market entry of any Ansell product.

During the year Ansell completed the purchase of Johnson and
Johnson
'
s medical glove business. This has already been well
integrated into Ansell
'
s operations and will make a full years
contribution to this years results.

The remaining Pacific Dunlop business is the joint venture in South
Pacific Tyres with The Goodyear Tire 
&
 Rubber Company. The tyre
industry, worldwide, is going through a very difficult period. There
is global over-capacity, mainly because manufacturers invested in
Asia before that region experienced its economic difficulties, in the
expectation of much higher economic growth in the region. The
consequence has been the import of cheap tyres from Asia into the
developed economies, including the USA and Australia. This has
affected volumes and margins. Goodyear has announced that it will
break even at best for the remainder of the year and possibly incur a
small loss. The difficulties being experienced by other major
international tyre companies, Bridgestone-Firestone and Michelin,
have also been well reported. The Australian manufacturers are not
immune from the effects of this imbalance in the market.

The problems in our tyre business have been exacerbated because
productivity has not kept pace with cost increases. This is a problem
which the new Managing Director of South Pacific Tyres, Mr Rob
McInery, has as an urgent task to fix. We are also engaged in
discussions with Goodyear to address the longer term positioning of
this business.

As we have reported to shareholders, in relation to the Telectronics
pacing leads the settlement which had been approved by the US
District Court in Cincinnati was overturned on appeal to the US
Federal Court of Appeal in July. The matter has been returned to the
District Court, and we are back in the Court process. The litigation
in Australia has been settled but there are still a number of matters
unresolved in other countries. While this drags on, the timing is out
of our control. The Board, however, continues to believe that the
overall financial exposure of the Group to these matters is
adequately covered by a combination of existing provisions and
insurance.

As shareholders have been previously advised, the Head Office of the
Company has been relocated from 101 Collins Street in the city to 678
Victoria Street, Richmond. This relocation combines the Head Office
management of the Company with the leadership of our Supply Chain
Group, eBusiness unit and Pacific Brands. This not only reduces
rental costs and overheads but will improve internal communications.

I have given a fairly full picture of the actions that the Board and
management have taken, and are taking, to put the Company on a sound
footing in order to enhance shareholder value. This task is not
finished. Change will continue to be a feature of the globalised
economy in which we have to operate.

The Board responded to the lower profitability of the Company in this
last year by reducing the dividend to an annual rate of ten cents per
share. This is, naturally, a decision which we did not enjoy making
but in the current circumstances the Directors saw no real
alternative. A dividend rate of ten cents a share is a level which we
feel should be sustainable. We appreciate that many smaller
shareholders, in particular, are affected by the reduction in the
dividend rate. However, the combination of measures which we have
adopted are, we believe, in the best overall interests of
shareholders in the longer term. The share buy-back is expected to
improve the earnings per share which, hopefully, should be reflected
in the share price.

OUTLOOK

If I can sum up the past year, a lot has been achieved.

We have satisfactorily dealt with some of the most troubling issues
affecting the Company
'
s performance but there is still more to do.

We have initiated measures to give us a solid, long-term platform for
more competitive performance and growth in today
'
s electronic age.
Customer service has also been focused on and given a much higher
priority.

In doing all this, we have at the same time made Pacific Dunlop a
stronger company financially. In the process, we have become a
smaller company, with revenue some \$2 billion less than last year as
a result of the sale of businesses. Consequently, absolute profit may
also be lower.

However, the reduced asset base combined with the share buy-back
means that this year we can aim for improved shareholder value in the
form of higher earnings per share.

The current year has opened with slower demand following the
introduction of GST and the build up to and staging of the Olympic
Games, which is likely to adversely affect the first halfs results.
Despite this, improved earnings per share are forecast for the full
year.

Before asking the Managing Director to comment further on the Group
'
s
operations I would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of
two Directors of the Company who retired from the Board during the
last financial year. Margaret Jackson was a highly effective Director
who also chaired, in a very competent manner, the Audit Committee and
the Employees
'
 Superannuation Fund, Robert Hershan, an Executive
Director and a long time senior Executive of the Company, did much to
establish the strength of the Company
'
s brands in the consumer
market. 

In this latter regard I am sure shareholders were pleased to see how
the Bonds brand figured prominently on the colorful uniforms of the
volunteers who performed so magnificently during Sydney
'
s successful
Olympic Games.

Now, Mr Chadwick will comment on the Group
'
s operations

PORT DOUGLAS REEF RESORTS LIMITED
Brisbane
Port Douglas Reef Resorts Limited (
"
PDRR
"
) today announced that it
had entered into a contract to sell the 300 room Radisson Reef Resort
for a consideration of \$17.5 million.

The Company
'
s Managing Director, Mr Greg Shaw, said that the sale was
an important strategic move for PDRR after a significant turnaround
in operating profit had been achieved since June 1998. He confirmed
that pre-tax operating profits in excess of \$3 million were forecast
in the year to June 2000 (1999 \$586,000).

The sale would reduce gearing to less than 10% of net assets on
completion anticipated in early November. Accordingly, PDRR is now in
a position to pursue other investment opportunities that provide
improved earnings potential and greater geographic diversity.

In Port Douglas, the Company would concentrate on the operation of
Radisson Treetops Resort and the Rainforest Habitat Wildlife
Sanctuary which had both demonstrated consistent profit growth for
several years. Mr Shaw advised that the increasing popularity of the
Port Douglas destination particularly in international markets had
resulted in strong growth in room nights of 28% from the UK and 48%
from the USA for the 12 month period to June 2000. The Olympic Games
will reinforce our position in the market with extensive Worldwide
coverage of both Port Douglas and The Great Barrier Reef expected to
boost international patronage in future years. in the domestic market
improved volumes are also anticipated with the entry of new players
in the airline industry.

Mr Shaw also confirmed that The Links Golf Course had been completed
as scheduled on the 30th June and ClubCorp commenced operations on
11th July under the Lease and Purchase Agreement negotiated in 1999.
Initial feedback on the Thomson, Wolveridge 
&
 Perrett designed Links
Course has been exceptional and active promotion of the facility is
expected to attract a broader range of domestic leisure and
conference business to the region.

Under the Agreement, Club Corporation of America will proceed to
purchase the course within a five year term.

Port Douglas Reef Resorts is now well progressed with the development
of luxury golf course villas adjoining the course and have recently
announced the appointment of Peppers Hotels to manage the integrated
resort. The second stage of 10 villas is scheduled for completion in
October and the third stage of 28 apartments is now due to commence
in the final quarter of 2000.

PRUDENTIAL INVESTMENT COMPANY OF AUSTRAL
Sydney
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
'
S REPORT

In this my first report to shareholders, I am pleased to announce
that the result after abnormals for the half year to 31 December 1999
was a significant improvement over the comparable period in 1998. The
operating loss before income tax improved from \$1,071,034 to
\$287,226.

The result, while disappointing, was a significant improvement on
the budgeted loss expected for the period. It was helped by a strong
profit for the month in December 1999 which significantly reduced the
year-to-date loss up until the end of November.

That trend has continued with another strong profit performance in
January 2000. On present indications, it is likely the company will
generate a meaningful profit before income tax by year-end.

This turnaround in performance results from cost-savings arising from
the organisational restructure, a greater emphasis on revenue
collection, and the commencement of cost benefits from the company
'
s
IT 
"
roll-out
"
. The corporate office and all 11 branches are now fully
integrated into the company
'
s internal Email and Business
Applications system.

At the same time, the revenue stream from the management of
Australia
'
s largest strata/body corporate management portfolio has
been solid, with high retention rates. Significantly, the company
'
s
management role at Queensland
'
s Sanctuary Cove was extended, as were
a number of other landmark residential areas.

The company
'
s acknowledged expertise in strata/body corporate
management has led to an increase in lots under management including
the addition of such prestigious residential developments as 
"
Finger
Wharf
"
 in Woolloomooloo, Sydney. Those successes reflect the relative
stability of staff in recent times and improved service levels to
the industry.

Paramount Asset Management also won further appointments, including
the 
"
Peninsula
"
 - the redevelopment of the former Colgate-Palmolive
site on the waterfront in Balmain, Sydney. At present paramount is
making a small but increased contribution to group profit.

During the successful implementation of the company
'
s major IT

"
roll-out
"
, it became apparent that the Company
'
s data-base growth
needed to be matched by a review of its main-frame capacity. At the
end of January 2000 an order was placed for a new IBM AS/400 Model
720-2061/ 1500, at an approximate cost of \$420,000. The timing was
opportune as IBM increased its prices by 60% shortly thereafter. The
placing of the order in January saved the company over \$200,000 in
additional costs. While a number or finance options are under active
consideration, the expenditure can be met through the company
'
s cash
reserves and existing undrawn credit line.

The new main-frame will arrive in mid March 2000. It will allow the
consolidation of the 2 existing environments onto the new system, so
allowing one of them to be used full-time in new development
applications fulfilling the company
'
s E-commerce plans, especially
its B2B activities.

Commensurate with this, IT staff has grown from 1 at the beginning of
October 1999 to 6 at this time (including a contract programmer).

Having successfully weathered Y2K issues, the Company
'
s Current focus
is on GST. With the large number of plans potentially eligible to
register for GST, the company has successfully gained Registered
Supplier status from the ATO. We are well progressed with the GET
software enhancements required to implement the new tax regime within
the company
'
s corporate environment, as well as on behalf of the
plans under management.

The group continues to amortise its Management Agreements in
accordance with Australian Accounting Standards Board, Interpretation
A1. Such amortisations do not alter the fundamental value of the
business. In reviewing the organisational structure of the company it
has become clear that a number of plans do not generate the Board
'
s
required minimum revenue threshold. A review is currently underway on
how best to manage these plans. It is expected the company
'
s
E-commerce facilities will be utilised.

In making the changes considered necessary to return the company to
profitability and to develop its E-commerce plans, the positive
support of staff has enabled these changes to be implemented quickly
and efficiently with no decrease in customer services. Instead,
service levels have risen as the staff have embraced the new
corporate strategy. The installation of the new main-frame and
implementation of the GST are major challenges over the second half
of the year. I am confident that the continued goodwill and support
of the staff will ensure an even more successful second half year.

LISTING RULE 3.1

Listing rule 3.1 requires an entity to give ASX immediately any

'

rule.

In responding to this letter you should consult listing rule 3.1 and

If you are unable to respond by the time requested, or if the answer

hesitate to contact the undersigned.

CHAIRMAN


ASX QUERY

Australian Stock Exchange Limited (
"
ASX
"
) has noted a change in the
price of your securities from \$3.60 on 10 January 2000 to \$4.40
today.

We regard timely disclosure of relevant information as of prime
importance in the operation of an efficient market. Listing rule 3.1
is a particularly important listing rule. It is part of ASX
'
s
continuous disclosure regime and is based on the following principle:

Timely disclosure must be made of information which may affect
security values or influence investment decisions, and information in
which security holders, investors and ASX have a legitimate interest.

In the absence of any information which explains the price change
referred to above, we wish to make the following enquiries:

1. Are any matters of importance concerning the Company about to be
announced to securirtyholders and/or the market? If so, can an
announcement be made immediately?

2. Is the Company aware of any information concerning it which, had
it been available to the market, might reasonably be regarded as an
explanation for recent trading in the securities of the Company?

3. Does the Company have any reason to believe that there will be a
change in the operating profit/loss before abnormal items and income
tax such that the figure for the period ended 31 December 1999 would
vary from the previous corresponding period by more than 15%?

4. Does the Company have reason to believe that it will record any
material abnormal or extraordinary profits/losses for the period
ended 31 December 1999?

5. Is the Company able to offer any other explanation for the price
change in the securities of the Company?

6. Can the Company confirm to ASX chat it is in compliance with the
listing rules and, in particular, listing rule 3.1?

The queries set out above cover matters of current specific interest
to us. However, we cannot be aware of all the information which would
be required to ensure that the market is properly informed in
accordance with listing rule 3.1. Accordingly, we would emphasise
that your responsibility under that listing rule is not confined to,
or necessarily satisfied by, answering the specific requests set out
in this letter.

If the information requested is information required to be released
pursuant to listing rule 3.1 your obligation is to disclose the
information immediately. Otherwise, your co-operation in lodging a
reply in a format suitable for release to the market is required as
soon as possible and, in any event, not later than 12.00 MIDDAY ESDT
on Wednesday 12 January 2000. Your response should be sent directly
to me on facsimile number (02) 9241 7620. It should not be sent to the
Company Announcements Office.

If you are unable to respond by that time you may wish to request a
trading halt in the Company
'
s securities. As set out in listing rule
17.1 and the 
"
Trading Halts
'
 Guidance Note we may grant a trading
halt at your request. We may require the request to be in writing. We
are not required to act on your request. You must tell us each of the
following:

* The reasons for the trading halt. 
* How long you want the trading halt to last. 
* The event you expect to happen that will end the trading halt. 
* That you are not aware of any reason why the trading halt should 
  not be granted. 
* Any other information necessary to inform the market about the
  trading halt, or that we ask for.

The trading halt cannot extend past the commencement of normal
trading on the second day after the day on which it is granted. If a
trading halt is requested and granted and you are still unable to
reply to this enquiry prior to the commencement of trading,
suspension from quotation would normally be imposed by us from the
commencement of trading if not previously requested by you.

If you have any queries regarding any of the above, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

In November 1999, Hanson Australia Proprietary Limited (
"
Hanson
"
), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Hanson PLC, announced a takeover offer for
the ordinary shares of Pioneer International Limited (
"
Pioneer
"
). The
Consideration offered was one Hanson share plus A\$35.75 for every ten
Pioneer shares.

On 10 May 2000, it was announced that Hanson had a relevant interest
in 97.83% of the issued ordinary shares of Pioneer, and that Hanson
intended to proceed with compulsory acquisition of the remaining
ordinary shares of Pioneer. Trading of Pioneer shares on ASX ceased
on 19 May 2000.

Clause 4.1(d) of the Terms of Issue of the PEWEMF Portfolio
Endowment Warrants (
"
Terms of Issue
"
) states that both the cash
component of the Consideration and the value of the Hanson shares
issued to Pioneer shareholders as part of the Consideration for
Pioneer shares are to be treated as a Reduction Amount. The Reckoning
Day for this Reduction Amount will be 31 May 2000.

The value of the Hanson shares is defined by clause 4.2(a) of the
Terms of Issue as the weighted average price (excluding special
sales, overseas sales and option exercises) on the first three days
on which trading takes place. Hanson commenced trading on ASX on 15
May 2000.

The weighted average price for Hanson on the first three days of
trading (15, 16, and 17 May 2000) was \$12.337 per share. This gives a
total value for the takeover Consideration of \$48.087 per ten Pioneer
shares, or \$4.8087 per share. The Portfolio underlying each 1,000
PEWEMFs contained 20 Pioneer shares, so the Reduction Amount will be
\$96.174 per 1,000 PEWEMFs, or \$0.09617 per PEWEMF.

PROTEL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
Sydney
REVIEW OF THE YEAR

Protel
'
s first full year as a public company has been a great
success. Prospectus forecasts were exceeded with excellent growth in
both Revenue and Profitability. A number of successful acquisitions
have been undertaken and the company has grown significantly in terms
of both number of employees and market capitalisation.


REVENUE GROWTH

The past financial year saw Protel
'
s revenue grow to \$33.9M this was
up 57% on the previous financial year and 27% above the prospectus
forecast.


PROFITABILITY GROWTH

An \$8 million profit after tax was achieved representing a 110%
increase over the previous financial year, this figure also bettered
prospectus forecasts by 15%.

We believe these successful results were achieved through a
combination of both increased sales and a broadening of the Protel
Product line which included the newly acquired P-CAD and FPGA
software.


DIVIDED 

Due to the acquisition of Accel Technologies, Protel was unable to
issue a half-year dividend, however, on the 29th September 2000
Protel was pleased to distribute a fully franked full year dividend
payment of 6c per share. This dividend was 62% above the previous
year and 9% above prospectus forecasts.


FRANKING

The board intends to continue its stated dividend policy of
distributing 50% of after tax profits, however, due to the recoupment
of losses made by Accel prior to our acquisition of that company, we
find ourselves not having to pay tax in the US for some time. Whilst
this is beneficial from a cash flow point of view, it does not
however provide franking credits for dividends. Therefore whilst it
is the directors intention to pay a dividend in the ensuring year,
they will not however be able to provide franking credits.


ACQUISITIONS

PAST FINANCIAL YEAR

ACCEL TECHNOLOGIES INC 

In January 2000 Protel acquired Accel Technologies a well known
US-based desktop EDA software developer for approx \$26M. The
successful integration and restructure of Accel is now complete.
Within 4 months of acquiring the Accel business, Protel had
re-structured the sales model, redesigned the product offering and
turned the loss-making business into a positive cashflow business.
This acquisition has strategically positioned Protel to significantly
increase its market share in the US.

METAMOR INC 

In June 2000 Protel acquired Metamor Inc, in order to complete the
necessary components of its first generation FPGA product line,
enabling Protel to enter into the chip level design market. This
market opens long-term opportunities for Protel to greatly extend and
build on its core user base. Protel has already successfully launched
its first FPGA product, with the more sophisticated and advanced FPGA
version due out shortly.


CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR

ICS 

On the 4th August Protel acquired Innovative CAD Software (ICS),
providing Protel with an array of CAM products and technologies. The
functionality and features offered by CAMtastic!(TM) are highly
complementary to Protel
'
s existing product lines.

CAM technology is used to prepare a design for fabrication and allows
the designer to exert a high degree of control over manufacturing
data. We will integrate the CAM technology into the Protel, P-CAD and
CircuitMaker product lines whilst also maintaining a focus on the
further development of stand-alone CAM tools. This acquisition brings
Protel a step closer to fulfilling one of its primary aims of being
able to meet every element of our customers
'
 design requirements.

In line with our prospectus objectives, we continue to actively
pursue our acquisition program.


OUTLOOK

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK 

We see the outlook for this financial year as very positive with the
established growth trend set over the last three to four years,
expected to continue.

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO GROWTH

* Protel
'
s first quarter performance has been strong and we are
confident that we will finish the calendar year 2000 on target.

* Recently released industry data (EDA Consortium) indicates strong
growth in the EDA market, particularly in Protel
'
s primary PCB
market.

* The EDA Consortium reported total FDA revenues increased by 14% for
the 2nd quarter of year 2000 on a year to year basis.

* The fastest growing category for the sixth consecutive quarter was
design tools for PCB-boards.

* The windows based segment of the market for the first half of the
year 2000 has grown from 14% to 16%. This growth is in line with the
success of windows 2000

PRESTON RESOURCES LIMITED
Perth
INTRODUCTION

Bulong achieved record cobalt production of 31.7 tonnes for the month
of January. Nickel dispatched was 18.7% below target (414 tonnes).
This was due to an increase in inventory levels necessary to bring
the remaining electrowinning cells on line, piping failures in the
leach circuit, and deterioration of brickwork in the high pressure
heating stage which feeds to the autoclave. Nickel metal quality
remained high in January at 99.8%. Cobalt metal quality improved
during the month to 99.5% Co.

Utilisation constraints in the leach circuit (mainly caused by gypsum
build up) were mitigated by feeding ore grades of up to 2% N. The
remaining 12 electrowinning cells in the nickel electrowinning
circuit were commissioned. The tank house is now fully operational
with 64 cells oil line.

PRODUCTION

The table below sets forth production performance for January and year
to date as compared with ramp-up estimates:

Nickel production was 18.7% below plan, primarily as a result of
lower utilisation and lower recovery. Utilisation decreased from 61%
in December to 57% in January, while recovery decreased from 83% in
December to 79% in January. Although much of the reduced output was a
direct result of mechanical defects, it wits necessary to increase
the inventories of nickel in circuit to allow the remaining 12 nickel
electrowinning cells to be commissioned. A total of 47 tonnes of
nickel was added to inventory. Nickel production for the period
October 1999 to January 2000 was 1,742 tonnes compared with planned
output of 1,732 tonnes.

Cobalt recoveries improved to 60% (from 55% in December). Although
record cobalt production was achieved in January, cobalt output
remained 1.3% below plan. Cobalt production for the period October
1999 to January 2000 was 89.5 tonnes, as compared to planned
production of 97 tonnes. Repairs to corrosion damage on the Cobalt
sulphide autoclave commenced and most of the design work for the
cobalt refinery upgrade was completed.

MINING

A total of 246,842 BCM of material was mined for the month,
comprising 77,778 BCM of ore and 169,064 BCM of waste. All ore was
mined from the Albion pit and the bulk of the waste was from the
developing Federal pit. High grade stocks amounted to 201,450 tonnes
as of January 31, 2000. High grade contained nickel and cobalt
reconciliations were 100% and 98%.

Production scale ore drying continued at reduced rates due to
rainfall. Feeding ore of reduced moisture content has continued to
result in improved feed preparation performance. This has
significantly reduced mill blockages and resulted in less clay being
rejected from the log washer scalping screen. This is likely to have
a long term benefit in ore feed beneficiation.

METALLURGICAL PERFORMANCE

Ore processed for the month was 12.6% lower than plan. A total of
34,581 tonnes of ore was treated, as compared to 33,369 tonnes in
December. Nickel head grades of 1.93% exceeded plan by 0.11%Ni while
cobalt grades were marginally lower than plan.

LEACH PLANT

Lower leach plant availability was mainly attributable to:

* Failures, due to erosion, of the slurry lines between flash tanks,
and

* blockages of the autoclave feed pump suctions with brick, mortar
and scale emanating from the high-pressure heater.

The cause of premature failure of the slurry line has been
investigated and preventative measures taken to improve service life.
To enable future repairs of the high pressure heater vessel, while
minimizing the impact on leach plant availability, a method of
bypassing the high-pressure beater has been developed and piping is
being fabricated to allow such repairs to take place outside of the
major shutdowns

PHOENIX TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION LIMITED
Sydney
Phoenix Technology Corporation Limited announced today the
establishment of a joint venture with Dahua Group Limited for the
construction of a Phoenix Plant in Dalian, China.

This announcement follows the Memorandum of Understanding with the
City of Dalian, which was confirmed at an official Signing Ceremony
in Sydney in February.

Dahua, the second largest chemical manufacturer in China (and one of
the few Chinese listed companies possessing an AAA credit rating)
will be equal partners with Phoenix in the new joint venture to be
known as Dalian Phoenix New Building Materials Co Limited (
"
Dalian
PTL
"
). In the past Dahua has participated in joint ventures with other
large international corporations such as Texaco and BOC.

Mr Walter Filler, Managing Director, Phoenix Technology Corporation,
who led the team that successfully completed these negotiations said

"
These shareholding and license agreements mark the next important
step for Phoenix, particularly as we are dealing with a large and
reputable group that has a strong market position.
"
"
As part of the shareholding agreement with Dahua, the local
government has guaranteed a 15 year supply of waste to the plant in
addition to a guarantee to sell all product manufactured by the plant
for a period of 5 years. The Dalian Municipal Government backs these
guarantees.


"
The speed with which these contracts have been signed is unusual
when dealing with Chinese authorities, and this reflects the high
value the Chinese Government places on our technology
"
 said Mr
Filler.

The next step in this process is for a feasibility study to be
completed by a Working Group operating under the auspices of the
newly formed joint venture company. Phoenix Technology Corporation
will manage this process, and will supply the technological expertise
required by the study. It will focus on localised infrastructure
requirements, such as an analysis of the waste stream, localisation
of the Standard PTL Plant design, and the most appropriate housing
design. The end result will be a specific action plan and blue prints
to build the plant licensed by Phoenix.

PROPERTY TRUST OF AUSTRALASIA
Sydney
A meeting of unitholders of the Property Trust of Australasia was
held at 10:00 am on Thursday, 29 June 2000.

Unitholders of PYT were asked to consider and resolve upon the three
substantive resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting (
"
Notice of
Meeting
"
) and Explanatory Statement dated 5 June 2000.

The unitholders present in person or by proxy resolved to choose
Australia Asia Investment Management Ltd (
"
AAIM
"
) as proposed
responsible entity of PYT and resolved not to wind up PYT.

In relation to the resolution to modify the trust deed, while the
majority of unitholders voted in favour of the resolution, the
resolution was ultimately not carried as the requisite majority
required by section 1069A of the Corporations Law was not met.
Accordingly, as foreshadowed in the Notice of Meeting, only those
modifications necessary to have, or consequential upon having, PYT
registered as a managed investment scheme are expected to be made.

MEDIA RELEASE

Sausage Software Limited has formed a strategic global alliance with
Unisys to develop and deliver leading eBusiness solutions to clients
worldwide.

Announcing the alliance today, The Minister for Communications,
Information Technology and the Arts, Senator the Hon Richard Alston,
said the Sausage and Unisys global partnership signals a
strengthening of e-solution practices and technology that will have
enormous benefits for future industry developments whilst boosting
export opportunities for Australia.

Sausage Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lloyd Roberts said, 
"
This
significant development is part of our strategy to align Sausage with
key global players and consolidate our services to increase
profitability and shareholder value through controlled growth.
"
"
This partnership springboards Sausage into the global market,
enabling us to tap into the US\$7.5 billion Unisys market by
developing a strategic partnership with a major global company that
complements and adds value to our business as well as becoming an
important service provider to our client base.
"
"
The alliance will significantly increase market share value and
opportunities for both companies through exploitation and
maximisation of synergistic benefits, and we expect our market share
to more than double.
"


Unisys Managing Director, Mr Ron Frankenfield said the company was
excited to be part of the alliance and work closely with Australia
'
s
leading, innovative, technology and new media company.


"
By combining our services with Sausage, we can now offer our clients
worldwide creative content delivery at highly competitive prices and
we plan to use this capability to provide cost effective services and
solutions to our clients across the globe. Australia will also reap
the benefits of substantial industry growth through the export of
this unique intellectual property and capability.
"


Mr Roberts added that the intention is to target four specific
markets - Australian SMEs and globally, transport and aviation,
education and interactive development - and generate significant
outcomes for companies and players within these segments.


"
This alliance will provide SMEs with the opportunity to move their
businesses online at affordable costs and technically low risk. By
taking advantage of the eBusiness benefits this alliance provides,
small businesses can concentrate on their core activities and
maximise capabilities to compete with major corporates previously
unavailable because of costly infrastructure and non-core expense.
"
"
For the transportation and airline industry, Sausage will strengthen
Unisys
'
 existing platform of services through the provision of new
eBusiness IT products specifically designed to improve quality and
efficiency in the customer relationship management and loyalty
areas,
"
 Mr Roberts said.

The Sausage/Unisys alliance will also generate major benefits for the
education sector, with the potential to significantly boost education
services exports.


"
We intend to expand our education capabilities and utilise Unisys
'

services to host worldwide delivery to facilitate an increase in the
use of Australian content and expertise overseas.
"
"
Confirming Sausage
'
s strong and reputable position within the local
Australian market, the alliance also reinforces the company
'
s
commitment to aggressive global growth and expansion,
"
 Mr Roberts
concluded.

NOTE 1

THE CARRYING VALUE OF STADIUM AUSTRALIA

The carrying value of Stadium Australia was determined by independent
valuation. At 30 June 2000 an independent valuation of Stadium
Australia was undertaken by Ernst 
&
 Young Corporate Finance. The
valuation was based on the expected net cash flows arising from the
Trust
'
s continued leasehold interest in the Stadium over the term of
the Trust Lease with OCA, discounted to their net present value.

Subsequent to the 30 June 1999 independent valuation the Stadium has
been amortised over its expected useful life. At 30 June 2000 the
Stadium was independently valued by Ernst 
&
 Young again. In the
opinion of Ernst 
&
 Young the value fell within the range of \$150
million and \$165 million. As the carrying value fell within this
range no adjustment to the carrying value of the Stadium was
considered necessary.

FLINDERS INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY TRUST
Sydney
LETTER TO UNITHOLDERS

Stockland is now pleased to provide to you its formal Offer to
acquire all of your units in the Flinders Industrial Property Trust.
Stockland believes that its Offer provides superior value to
the offer made to you by Goodman Hardie.

Stockland is currently the fifth largest property trust listed in
Australia, with a market capitalisation in excess of \$1.5 billion.
Stockland has a diversified portfolio of investment properties, with
a strong track record of delivering growth to its investors, and a
management team with a considerable depth of experience and expertise
in Australian property development and management.

Currently Stockland
'
s property portfolio comprises substantially
retail and commercial assets, residential development properties and
a hotel management business. The opportunity to include the Flinders
industrial portfolio introduces the only significant property asset
class not presently represented. Post acquisition, these industrial
assets would represent approximately 19% of total assets.

The Stockland Trust Group comprises Stockland Trust and Stockland 
Corporation, the units and shares in which are listed together on the 
ASX as a single 
"
stapled
"
 security. This allows Stockland to undertake
businesses such as property trading, development and management, so 
that development opportunities can be exploited and the profits and 
benefits retained within Stockland. This is particularly relevant to 
the Flinders Portfolio where there are a number of development 
opportunities.

Stockland Trust is also internally managed which means that investors 
do not have to pay fees to an external manager.

DETAILS OF STOCKLAND
'
S OFFER

Stockland is offering you the flexibility of accepting either of two
alternatives:

* Full Scrip Alternative: 1 Stockland Stapled Security for every 2.8
                          Flinders Units; or

* Cash and Scrip 
  Alternative:            1 Stockland Stapled Security plus \$2.50
                          in cash for every 5 Flinders Units.

Under both alternatives, you will be entitled to retain the
distribution on your Flinders Units for the six month period ending
30 June 2000. This distribution has been forecast by the Manager of
Flinders to be 5.6 cents per Flinders Unit. The Stockland Stapled
Securities issued to accepting Flinders Unitholders will be entitled
to accrue Stockland Distributions from 1 July 2000 (ie first
distribution calculated as at 31 December 2000).

S OFFER

The principal benefits for Flinders Unitholders in accepting
Stockland
'
s Offer and the Merger Proposal proceeding are:

Significant Premium to Goodman Hardie Offer: Based on the closing
prices of Stockland and Goodman Hardie on 22 May 2000 and Flinders on
9 May 2000 (the day prior to Stockland announcing its Offer):

* The Full Scrip Alternative equates to \$1.26 per Flinders Unit and a
premium of 12% over the Flinders Unit price and 12% over the Goodman
Hardie Offer.

* The Cash and Scrip Alternative equates to \$1.21 and a premium of 7%
over the Flinders Unit price and 7% over the Goodman Hardie Offer.

Strong Financial Position: The Merged Entity will have lower gearing
than Flinders and Goodman Hardie with greater flexibility to pursue
growth initiatives.

Significant Reduction in Management Expenses: Stockland internally
manages its trusts and all properties, enabling the fees that would
otherwise be charged for these services to be retained by Stockland
for the benefit of all Stockland Security Holders.

Potential for increased Value: If the Merged Entity trades at the
same forecast 2001 yield at which Stockland is currently trading,
assuming 100% acceptances under either alternative, the Offers
(excluding the distribution entitlement and the value of franking
credits) are equivalent to:

* For the Full Scrip Alternative, \$1.29 per Flinders Unit, (based on
the closing price of Stockland on 22 May 2000), showing a premium of
16 cents per Flinders Unit and 14% over the closing price of Flinders
Units on 9 May 2000;

* For the Cash and Scrip Alternative, \$1.24 per Flinders Unit, (based
on the closing price of Stockland on 22 May 2000), showing a premium
of 11 cents per Flinders Unit and 10% over the closing price of
Flinders Units on 9 May 2000.

Enhanced Index Weighting: The Merged Entity will have a greater
weighting in benchmark ASX indices, and the Merger Proposal removes
the risk of Flinders being excluded from the S
&
P/ASX 200 Index and
the consequent risk of downward pressure on the price and liquidity
of Flinders Units.

Improved Property Portfolio: The Merged Entity will have one of the
largest property portfolios in the diversified property sector with a
broader mix of assets which is expected to deliver a more secure
income stream than the current Flinders Portfolio.

Greater Liquidity: Flinders Unitholders should enjoy greater
liquidity through becoming security holders in the Merged Entity
which, assuming 100% acceptances, should have a market capitalisation
in excess of \$1.65 billion.

Management Team: While the Stockland management team has many decades
of experience in all facets of property development including
commercial, retail, hotels, residential and industrial, its
activities in recent years did not include any industrial properties.
Industrial developments are not vastly different from other
commercial developments.

Not withstanding this it is Stockland
'
s intention to enlarge its team
by offering employment opportunities to property management and
operations staff currently employed by the Manager of Flinders,
subject to satisfactory terms being negotiated. Should Stockland be
unable to obtain their services, Stockland will strengthen our team
with other executives with recent experience in the industrial
development field.

We would be delighted to welcome you as an investor in Stockland
through this Merger. If you have any questions or queries associated
with our Offer, we have set up for your convenience a toll free
enquiry centre on 1800 251 813.

STRIKER RESOURCES NL
Perth
We wish to advise that the company has recovered additional diamonds
from the Year 2000 processing from Ashmore 1 and 2 pipes. They were
obtained from kimberlite excavated during the 1999 season with a
total of 11,167 diamonds for 435 carats. During 1999, 13,000 diamonds
for 695 carats were recovered in the -10.0mm fraction from Ashmore 2
taking the total stones recovered from Ashmore to date to 24,687
diamonds for 1,130cts.

The largest diamonds recovered this year from Ashmore 2 were 2.49ct
and 2.1ct which were independently valued at \$US110/ct and \$US920/ct
respectively. Six diamonds weighed in excess of 1 carat, all
recovered from the same sample. The largest diamond from Ashmore 1
was a 0.90 ct diamond valued at \$US285.

Table 1: A summary of the diamond recoveries from Ashmore 1 and 2.

The material processed to date includes 11,312 wet tonnes from
Ashmore 2 which was processed to 10mm through the previous Heavy
Media Separation plant (
'
HMS
'
). The +10mm to 25mm fraction is stored
and awaits processing through the company
'
s new 25mm HMS over the
next few weeks. The 2000 program has been designed to examine the
potential for recovery above 10mm (approximately 10 carats) in size.
In addition, 0.8 to 10mm reject from the 1999 program will be passed
through the new plant for audit purposes. The oversize material from
the washing circuit and reject material of +10mm from the EMS will be
examined separately.

Results to date suggest that the grades of the processed ore blocks
in Ashmore 2 increase as the proportion of country rock xenoliths
decreases away from the wall rock contacts of the pipe. The least
contaminated blocks in Ashmore 2, located towards the western section
of the pipe produced sample grades of 15 to 27cts per 100 wet tonnes.

CURRENT PROCESSING OF 2000 KIMBERLITE

All excavation of kimberlite from Ashmore pipes 1, 2 and 4 has now
been completed with over 70,000 tonnes available for sample
selection. Processing of samples will be scheduled according to
lithology and associated to drill results from each pipe.

Moisture content analysis indicates up to 25% water by weight in some
samples. Processing of the wet material requires reprocessing to
allow the clay to breakup and liberate material suitable for HMS
feed.

The company has also made changes to its site operations to allow for
processing to continue during the on set of the wet season and on a
24 hour per day basis. This includes modifications to the plant,
accommodation and additional fuel storage.

As part of commissioning the new HMS and modifications to the washing
circuit over the past few weeks, 2,403 wet tonnes of Ashmore 1
kimberlite has been processed. Samples were selected for
commissioning to examine the plant performance in treating both
breccia and very wet clay-rich material.

Concentrates from scheduled processing are progressively being sent
to Perth for diamond recovery.

Diamonds currently being recovered from the commissioning samples at
Ashmore 1 include two pieces of one diamond weighing 2.65cts. The
diamond is pale yellow and inclusion free. Whilst diamond recovery
for all 2000 samples is incomplete, overall the diamonds recovered
from Ashmore 1 have less colouration and less inclusions than Ashmore
2 diamonds. Complete results and associated valuations will be
reported when they become available.

ASX CORRECTION TO ANNOUNCEMENT RELEASED 21/08/2000

SECURENET ACHIEVES STRONG FULL YEAR EARNINGS

SecureNet Limited (SNX.AX) today announced strong full year results,
with the company achieving operating profit before tax and equity
accounting of \$3.62 million, up 90% on the previous year. Earning
before interest and tax was \$2.19 million. After equity accounting,
the operating profit before tax was \$2.91 million an increase of 152%
on last year.

The company
'
s operating revenue increased 75 per cent to \$21.1
million - continuing the sharp upward tracking of SecureNet
'
s
performance over the past two years, when it recorded operating
revenue increases of 47 percent (97/98) and 92 percent (98/99).

Cash flows during the year showed a net increase in cash held of
\$87.3 million.

SecureNet
'
s Chairman, Mr David Greatorex, described the company
'
s
performance as excellent, with strong revenue growth underpinned by
positive earnings. 
"
With the company having had to invest heavily in
its own infrastructure to manage the forthcoming expansion expected
in the business, achieving both top line and earnings growth is an
outstanding result,
"
 he said.

He described, the achievements as a faithful delivery of every one of
the company
'
s promised objectives for the year.

SecureNet
'
s Managing Director, Mr Geoffrey Ross, said the past year
has been characterised by unprecedented accomplishment for the
company, with its strategy to achieve growth through strategic
alliances and partnerships succeeding to a point where a strong
momentum has been created to underpin continued solid growth.

During the financial year SecureNet has achieved a succession of
high-profile agreements relating to international partnering
arrangements, major contracts and investment by high-profile
corporations in its Australian and overseas joint venture operations.

THESE HAVE INCLUDED:

* the launch of a Hong Kong based joint venture with Cable 
&
 Wireless
HKT, providing linkages with the telecommunications giant into the
burgeoning e-commerce market of the Pan Asian region;

* a US\$5 million investment in SecureNet by the Intel group to expand
overseas marketing initiatives;

* a partnership agreement with Mondex International to develop smart
card based products and services;

* a AUD \$1.5 million contract to develop security infrastructure for
ANZ
'
s online service network;

* an agreement that has fused SecureNet
'
s e-commerce security platform
into the growth plans of the international telco Pacific Century
CyberWorks (PCCW) as it expands into eight new Pan Asian e-commerce
markets;

* investment by PCCW of AUD\$32 million in SecureNet;

* acquisition of the specialist e-commerce consulting firm Electronic
Trading Concepts;

* investment of US\$16 million by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation in SecureNet
'
s Cable 
&
 Wireless HKT joint venture.

Mr Ross said SecureNet
'
s plans for expansion into the markets of Pan
Asia are experiencing rapid growth and beginning to realise their
massive potential.


"
Already 47 per cent of our revenue is generated offshore and this
will grow now that we are the key provider of IT
&
T trust services to
the Pan Asian region. Our access to existing infrastructure will
enable us to immediately supply the surge in demand for online
services generated by an area containing almost half the world
'
s
population,
"
 he said.


"
Our activities in these areas will flourish quickly for the company,
producing a reliable, recurrent and high-growth revenue stream and
heightening our profile as a leading global provider of internet
security services and equipment.
"
"
Not only has SecureNet delivered in a fiscal sense this year but, at
the same time, has gained national and international recognition for
its product developments and marketing achievements - including an
Australian Export Award and the Asia Pacific Smart Card Forum award
for outstanding industry contribution,
"
 he said.

Mr Ross said that the past year has also seen SecureNet realign its
five former divisions into a single entity and adopt the SecureNet
name and branding across all its products and services.

He said the restructure has better positioned the company to propel
it into the coming period of strong growth and has provided an
integration of its business streams to more effectively respond to
the demands of increasingly complex and rapidly-evolving markets.


"
The active research and development program undertaken by SecureNet
has yielded some advanced and sought after products in the past year.
These include the first commercial release of a multi-application
smart card that has already been launched by Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation and a portable, and easy-to-use smart card-based
product that provides users of most popular email systems with
message security.
"


Mr Ross said the company
'
s already-strong alliances with major
interests in Europe - such as Zaxus Ltd (formerly Racal) and Mondex
International - auger well for subsequent expansion of SecureNet into
remaining world markets.


"
It is pleasing to announce that SecureNet is well advanced towards
realising its vision of becoming a global provider of information and
telecommunications security solutions,
"
 Mr Ross said.

GUINNESS PEAT GROUP PLC
Sydney
The 24 May announcement by the 
"
independent Directors
"
 raises a
number of questions.

1. It seems unsatisfactory that the full Board of Soul Pattinson is
apparently not properly dealing with important issues in relation to
its controlling interest in Brickworks Ltd. If there are such serious
conflicts of interest arising from the reciprocal shareholding
arrangements, would it be preferable for the excluded Directors to
resign entirely from the Soul Pattinson Board?

2. Are the 
"
independent Directors
"
 authorised to make all decisions
in respect of Brickworks shares and, if so, is it a permanent
authority which has been formally resolved by the full Board of Soul
Pattinson?

3. The 
"
independent Directors
"
 claim the GPG takeover offer

"
undervalues Soul Pattinson
'
s investment in Brickworks
"
. However, the
Brickworks
'
 target statement does not address the value of the offer
in any way. The target statement is entirely consumed with obscure
technical objections to the otherwise simple concept of releasing
Soul Pattinson shares to their ultimate owners.

In the circumstances, it is assumed the 
"
independent Directors
"
 have
access to information which has not been made available to other
shareholders in Soul Pattinson and Brickworks. We request the public
release of this information forthwith.

4. It is noted Soul Pattinson has obtained a valuation report from
KPMG Corporate Finance. In accordance with continuous disclosure
requirements, we request the immediate release of this report to the
Stock Exchange.

5. The 1999 Annual Report of Soul Pattinson states 
"
The performance
of non-executive directors is reviewed by the Chairman on an ongoing
basis. Any director whose performance is considered unsatisfactory
is asked to resign
"
. The Chairman of Soul Pattinson is also the
Chairman of Brickworks. Does this compromise the claimed

"
independence
"
 of 
"
independent Directors
"
?

6. The 
"
independent Directors
"
 claim the GPG offer undervalues
Brickworks
'
 shares. The current market price of Brickworks is
considerably less than the value of the GPG offer. Does Soul
Pattinson propose to acquire additional shares, particularly having
regard to its active purchases of other listed investments?

We look forward to your early reply. We have sent a copy of this
letter to the Takeover Panel.

WASHINGTON H SOUL PATTINSON
Sydney
"
Soul Pattinson is an active investment company, investing in a mix
of strong old economy and profitable new economy businesses, as well
as holding a significant portfolio of other listed investments. The
2000 year has been one of particular achievement for the company.

In my address to you today, I will briefly summarise the highlights
of this year and then discuss divisional performance, before
commenting on the outlook for the 2001 financial year
"


A YEAR OF ACHIEVEMENT


"
This slide demonstrates our achievements this year:

- we acquired the Oakleigh Colliery in Queensland;

- Clover Corporation listed on the Australian Stock Exchange;

- we acquired the Acland Coal Deposit, also in Queensland;

- Soul Pattinson Telecommunications commenced carrying traffic on its
network; and 

- we merged our pharmaceutical manufacturing and wholesaling
activities with API.

The year culminated in our achievement of record profits after tax of
\$49.7 million and record dividends of \$1.40 per share
"


CONTINUED GROWTH IN SALES


"
Soul Pattinson continued its pattern of sales growth in 2000,
reporting sales of \$851 million which reflected growth in all
industry segments.

As you can see on the slide, had the API transaction not taken place
in mid May of this year, total sales revenue would have been
approximately \$901 million, an increase of 7% over sales for 1999
"


CONTINUED GROWTH IN PROFIT AFTER TAX


"
Soul Pattinson continued its profit growth in 2000, with profit
after tax (and before abnormal items) increasing by 11.4% to \$49.7
million and profit after tax (and after abnormal items) increasing by
99.8% to \$106 million.

An abnormal profit of \$56 million, not shown on the graph, related to
the profit on sale of investments and the profit on the merger of the
pharmaceutical manufacturing and wholesaling businesses with API
"


11% INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE (BEFORE ABNORMALS)


"
When we turn to earnings per share, we can see a similar growth
pattern reflected. 

As you can see, earnings per share before abnormal items has
increased by 11.4% to 208.2 cents per share
"


12% INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PER SHARE


"
Earnings growth has also been passed on to shareholders in the form
of increased fully franked dividends.

Soul Pattinson has increased dividends in 2000 to \$1.40 per share,
compared to \$1.25 per share in 1999, paying a special dividend for
the third consecutive year.

The ordinary dividend, alone, has increased 50% from 1998 to 2000
"


DIVISIONAL PROFIT PERFORMANCE


"
On this slide you can see that almost 43% of our after tax profits
were derived from our investment portfolio, which includes
Brickworks, Clover, and now API.

Investments and our New Hope coal mining interests together account
for 73% of our portfolio.

Media, comprising 12% of after tax profits, is represented by our
ownership of NBN.

The profit contribution of Pharmaceuticals relates largely to the
period before our business was merged with API. Soul Pattinson has
retained only the retailing activities. In the future, returns from
API will be treated as part of our investment portfolio.

Other industries comprise the Keith Harris fruit products, flavours
and fragrances business, Soul Pattinson Telecommunications and
property interests.
"


We have been able to alter the composition of our profits
significantly since 1996 without adversely affecting profitability.
In 1996, 54% of our profits were derived from coal
"


INVESTMENTS


"
Soul Pattinson
'
s investment portfolio performed well during 2000,
with a return on market value of investments before tax of 18.7%.
During the year, we invested \$21.7 million in listed investments.

Dividend income increased by 1.8% over the previous year, with total
dividend income for the group of \$20.4 million, including dividends
from associates.

95% of the current investment portfolio is listed, with a book value
of \$292 million. At 31 July, the market value of this portfolio was
\$629 million.

Market value increased further to \$634 million at 31 October
2000, despite market uncertainties and some stocks going ex dividend
"


BRICKWORKS


"
Included in our investment portfolio is our significant investment
in Brickworks, where we hold 49% of its issued capital.

Soul Pattinson
'
s share of Brickworks
'
 profit (excluding dividends
received from Soul Pattinson) was \$13.3 million for 2000, compared to
\$9.8 million in 1999.

Dividends received from Brickworks totalled \$12.5 million, an
increase of 9% on the previous year.

Shareholders should note that Brickworks has paid six consecutive
special dividends
"
"
Brickworks
'
 has been a successful investment for Soul Pattinson as
reflected in the share price increase of 75% over the past five
years. Total investment return has increased by 106% over the same
period.

As you can see from the chart, Brickworks
'
 has outperformed the All
Ordinaries Index consistently since January 1999, in a period where
other building materials companies have under-performed the market
"


API


"
Turning to another of our significant investments - API.

At this stage I
'
d like to extend a warm welcome to the Hon John
Matthews, Chairman of API.

In May 2000, your Directors decided that the merger of the
pharmaceutical wholesaling and manufacturing divisions of Soul
Pattinson with API would be in the best long term interests of
shareholders. In exchange, Soul Pattinson was allotted 49 million
shares making it the largest shareholder in API, with 25% of the
issued capital. 

These API shares were issued at \$2.01, valuing the transaction at
\$98.5 million and resulting in an abnormal profit of \$51.6 million.
API
'
s market capitalisation currently stands at \$464 million.

Your Directors are confident that equity accounted profits from our
investment in API will be higher than profits from the manufacturing
and wholesaling operations had they remained wholly owned by Soul
Pattinson.

As you can see from the graph, API shares are currently trading at
\$2.37 (ex dividend), well above Soul Pattinson
'
s entry price of 
\$2.01
"


CLOVER


"
Clover Corporation, another of our investments, is a leading
manufacturer of medically and nutritionally important oils and
functional food ingredients for the fast growing healthcare and
nutrition markets.

Clover listed on the Australian stock exchange on 30 November 1999 at
30 cents per share and is now trading at 45 cents, well above the
listing price. Soul Pattinson is the largest shareholder with 27.4%.

Clover processes South Pacific tuna oil which is the richest source
of DHA, an important omega-3 fatty acid. The health benefits of DHA
continue to grow in recognition, particularly its fundamental role in
brain and eye structure and function.

Significant gains in the area of research and development have linked
DHA to the treatment of asthma, depression, cardiovascular disease
and arthritis&

REVIEW OF ASSETS

'

unlocking value for shareholders. This review is continuing and has
been expanded to include an assessment of the current and future
values of operating mines including the Sebuku Coal Mine.

In line with the above decision the company has agreed, subject to

the Gouaro Prospect in PRA436, New Caledonia this morning at 0600
EST, Friday, 7 January 2000 was at 1,786 metres depth and drilling
ahead in NQ core.

Wireline logging (sonic and density) overnight from 1,619 metres to
1,783 metres was aborted because of problems with the sonic tool and
will be, run on completion of drilling. Drilling continues as very
high gas readings from coal units (to 9% methane) have been recorded
and fractured sands are currently being encountered. The coals are
the probable local source rocks for hydrocarbons in the area and are
favourably adjacent to potential good fractured clean sand reservoirs
that may be encountered in further drilling to total depth of 2,000
meters. Open hole drill stem testing of potentially fractured
sandstone reservoirs is also planned on completion of drilling.

TIGER INVESTMENT COMPANY LIMITED
Sydney
CHAIRMAN
'
S LETTER

I am happy to report that the directors are pleased with the progress
of Tiger to date and on behalf of the directors, I wish to thank you
for your continued support. However, in order to maximise shareholder
value, the Tiger board has adopted a strategy of reviewing all
aspects of Tiger
'
s cost structure and the basis on which it seeks to
implement its investment objectives. As a consequence of these
strategic objectives, the Tiger board proposes to enter into a scheme
of arrangement with Tiger
'
s parent, Metals Exploration Limited (MEX).

Therefore, I am very pleased to enclose this document which provides
full details of the proposed merger of MEX with Tiger Investment
Company Limited (Tiger).

The merger is to be effected by way of a scheme of arrangement,
whereby Tiger shares not currently owned by MEX will be cancelled in
exchange for MEX ordinary shares. The most significant results of
this proposed merger will be that:

* Tiger will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MEX; and

* Tiger shareholders will be offered 5 MEX ordinary shares for every 6
  Tiger ordinary shares that they hold.

It is also proposed that, conditional upon the approval and
implementation of the merger:

* Mr Peter H Cary will be appointed as Chairman of MEX; and

* another member of the current Tiger board, Graham Johnston, will 
  join the MEX board as a non-executive director.

BDO Nelson Parkhill (Securities) Pty Limited (BDO), which Tiger has
engaged as an independent expert, concludes in its report contained
at Part E of this booklet that the merger proposal is in the best
interests of Tiger shareholders.

The Tiger directors recommend the proposed merger. The Tiger
directors consider that the benefits flowing to Tiger shareholders
include:

* further diversification of investments and a resultant reduction of
  risk as a consequence of combining MEX
'
s and Tiger
'
s operations;

* an annual saving of approximately \$100,000 in corporate overheads,
  including costs associated with Tiger
'
s listed status;

* an enhancement in MEX
'
s ability to raise further capital to fund
  future expansion (should the need arise) as a result of the increase
  in MEX
'
s market capitalisation;

* an expected increase in the liquidity of MEX shares (which will be
  held by Tiger shareholders following the scheme) compared to the
  current liquidity of Tiger Shares (as a result of the increased size
  of the merged entities); and

* an expanded capital base, allowing the acquisition of strategic
  interests in operating businesses, rather than continuing the
  portfolio approach to investment.

The disadvantages of the scheme include that:

* the focus of the combined group may differ to Tiger
'
s current focus;

* Tiger shareholders lose a potential entitlement to dividends for the
  six month period to 31 December 1999; and

* cancellation of Tiger Shares will constitute a disposal of shares 
  for capital gains tax purposes, which may have tax consequences for 
  Tiger shareholders.

A number of meetings will be held to consider and implement the
proposed Scheme. If you are unable to attend the Tiger general
meetings on 31 January 2000 please complete and forward the enclosed
proxy forms as soon as possible so as to reach Tiger not later than
the time specified in the relevant notices of meeting. You are
welcome to attend and vote at the meetings in person, and the fact
that you have lodged a proxy form will not prevent you from doing so.

Remember, it is most important to register your vote, either by proxy
or at the meeting.

 TELCO OFFSHOOT TO DISCUSS ACCESS ARRANGEMENTS

Recently launched service provider Request DSL Pty Ltd (Request DSL)
has welcomed the commitment by Telstra Corp to allow access to its
local network, saying that it plans meetings with the
telecommunications giant to discuss access for its own ADSL
(asymmetrical digital subscriber line) technology.


"
This is a historic turning point for the Australian
telecommunications industry which, if reasonable commercial
arrangements for local access on the Telstra network can be
negotiated, will open the door to an historic new era of
telecommunications,
"
 said Request DSL
'
 Managing Director, Mr Greg
Pennefather.


"
We are talking to Telstra in Melbourne about the commercial terms
and a timetable for us to gain access to their customer access
network for our own ADSL roll-out,
"
 Mr Pennefather added.

Telstra announced last week that it would allow access to its local
network by August this year, clearing the way for other carriers to
roll-out competitive networks, such as ADSL, using the existing
Telstra copper wire network.

Request DSL, which expects to secure a telecommunications carrier
licence in the near future, is planning to deploy a nationwide
broadband network to serve Australian businesses and consumers using
ADSL technology provided by Cisco Systems (Cisco), the worldwide
leader in networking for the Internet.

ADSL networks, which can be installed at relatively low cost, allow
the transmission of data at speeds of up to 150 times faster than is
currently available.

Request DSL recently signed a binding Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) with Cisco covering an initial 3-month period, under which
Request DSL will work exclusively with Cisco or its nominated
partners to roll out a high bandwidth ADSL network across Australia.
During the 90-day period, both parties will investigate developing a
longer-term relationship.

Cisco Systems is a leading player in the ADSL market in the United
States. The company recently announced a second-quarter profit of
US\$906 million on revenue of US\$4.35 billion. In terms of market
capitalisation, Cisco is second only in size to Microsoft
Corporation.


"
With our Cisco alliance in place and the door now officially open to
access the Telstra network, we are able to move ahead immediately
with our roll-out plans,
"
 Mr Pennefather said.

The new network will give businesses and consumers throughout
Australia more affordable access to new and emerging Internet and
multi-media applications.

ADSL technology, which is currently used in the United States,
Singapore, Europe and New Zealand, can be deployed relatively easily
over existing copper wire-based telecommunications infrastructure.
ADSL boosts the capacity of traditional copper wire-based networks,
enabling them to transmit data up to 150 times faster than current
modem or ISDN copper delivery and bringing broadband access within
reach of millions of Australian homes for the first time.

With the backing and Eastern States connections of Cisco, Request DSL
is aiming to deploy its network nationally as quickly as possible.

ADSL offers a superior solution because it can be easily deployed
over existing infrastructure, it provides a direct, dedicated and
secure channel between the customer and the service provider, it is
scalable and does not require manual dial-up connections.

An ADSL network can be rolled-out by installing ADSL multiplexers at
existing telephone exchanges, with the only other special equipment
required being a compatible modem at the other end.

Pilbara Mines NL is in the process of acquiring an 80% interest in
Request DSL.

In November 1999 Tennyson began the roll-out of its SOX product
through its Australian and New Zealand distributors. The company
'
s
December
'

increase of 139% on the previous corresponding period.

In late November

international search for a highly experienced Chief Executive
Officer.

In February 2000 Tennyson appointed Mr David Ruby as its new CEO. Mr.
Ruby brings to Tennyson a wealth of experience with respect to the
establishment of international sales and distribution networks. His
immediate task is to rapidly globalise SOX network products.

SOX was exhibited at CeBIT 2000, the world

telecommunications trade show in Hannover, Germany in late February.
The company is extremely encouraged with the response the product
received. Mr Ruby is negotiating with a number of interested parties

Tennyson Nails SOX Deals in Israel

TENNYSON HOLDINGS LIMITED
Perth
Tennyson Networks Ltd (TNY) today announced it had secured its first
reseller agreements in Israel for its SOX (Small Office Exchange)

"
office in a box
"
 computer telephony integration platform.

The announcement follows hard on the heels of Tennyson
'
s first UK
distribution deal, announced on 25 May 2000.

The agreement will see the SOX platform sold through Power
Communication in Jerusalem and Harel-TopCom in Tel Aviv. Power
Communication has advised Tennyson that it has already secured orders
for SOX from end-users, including Co-op Jerusalem, the largest
supermarket chain in Israel, EMI Insurance and Israeli Seed Partners.

The creation of a powerful presence in the Israeli market reflects
Tennyson
'
s commitment to a global expansion strategy for the SOX
platform.

Mr David Ruby, Chief Executive Officer of Tennyson, said the deals
were in keeping with Tennyson
'
s new worldwide sales strategy.


"
This is terrific news for Tennyson. We are taking great steps
towards seizing a major chunk of the international PABX market.


"
We are interested in creating direct relationships with Value Added
Resellers and Integrators. We will not use two tier distribution
overseas because Tennyson wants to be as close as possible to its
customer base so that we can provide world class, industry best,
service and support.


"
We are extremely pleased to be in partnership with these two fine
organisations. Harel-TopCom through its Mehahel Software division
has already ported its Software Billing system to SOX. 
"
One of the
great strengths of SOX is that it is a flexible platform that can be
built upon by other companies to create a value added offering,
"
 
Mr Ruby said.

Naim Froimovici, Managing Director of Power Communications, said the
deal opened up new horizons for the company.


"
Power Communications is looking to reposition themselves around

"
Releasing the Power of SOXI
"
 tagline in leveraging this new
strategic relationship for the company,
"
 he said.

Harel-TopCom Managing Director Shami El-Dor said he was extremely
excited about the opportunity that the Tennyson products gave them to
not only sell SOX across country, but also to build up our software
systems offering,
"
 he said.

The deals with Power Communications and Harel-Topcom were negotiated
by Tennyson
'
s newly formed Milan office, headed by Mr Franco Dradi,
Vice President, Mediterranean Region.

The SOX platform, which was launched in Australia last year, brings
together voice, data, fax and internet services in a simple plug and
play box that can be integrated with other software products to
create a powerful business tool.

TERRAPLANET BUILDS ON ITS IMAGING

As a part of its aggressive growth strategy, terraplanet.com Limited
has acquired the digital imaging business, purescript,

purescript will complement terraplanet
'
s existing imaging arm, which
was purchased as part of terraplanet
'
s recent listing on the
Australian Stock Exchange. The acquisition will give terraplanet
greater power to manipulate digital content across all media forms,
including print, Internet - be it narrowband or broadband - and
wireless (WAP), as well as enhancing its software development
capabilities.


"
This is an exceptional acquisition for terraplanet,
"
 said Managing
Director Lesa-Belle Furhagen. 
"
We see the imaging business moving
from its more traditional role in the production of print media to a
growing role of digital content manipulation across all multimedia
forms, be it images, sound or video. As a multimedia infotainment
company, terraplanet creates high-quality niche content, and being
able to control the digital manipulation of that content enhances its
value.
"


terraplanet has a strong database of digital content, built over some
eight years, including text, images, sound, video, MP3 and DVD.
purescript
'
s digital imaging technology will boost the earnings
potential of terraplanet by enhancing its content. This will give
terraplanet a solid position on the multimedia stage, as greater
speed of delivery becomes available to the Internet. terraplanet
'
s
strategy is to provide content solutions that can be published across
mediums of choice.

purescript has web-hosting facilities which will enable terraplanet
to house its own network of websites in the future. terraplanet
'
s
publishing and online advertising clients will also benefit from
purescript
'
s expertise in web design.

The acquisition is earnings-per-share positive and will greatly
extend the multimedia capabilities of terraplanet.com Limited.
purescript is the second acquisition since the company
'
s listing, the
first being Australian Style.

MEDIA RELEASE

TOWER WELCOMES STANDARD AND POOR
'
S RATINGS

The announcement by Standard and Poor
'
s of A (strong) Financial
Strength Ratings for TOWER
'
s three major operating companies (Tower
Life Australia, Tower Life New Zealand (now part of Tower Managed
Funds (NZ)) and Tower Insurance), and BBB (good) long term and A-2
short term counterparty credit ratings for the Holding Companies was
welcomed today by the Group
'
s Managing Director James Boonzaier.


"
These ratings should be regarded as very positive by our
policyholders and investors in that they affirm Tower
'
s commitment to
building a secure diversified Australasian business.
"
 Mr Boonzaier
noted that the comment by this highly regarded rating agency that

"
the ratings reflect the Group
'
s excellent business profile in New
Zealand and emerging profile in Australia, strong operating
performance and balance sheet structure
"
 is welcome support for the
growth strategy that Tower has followed for almost a decade.

Mr Boonzaier stated that 
"
the BBB (Good) and A-2 short term Tower
Holding Companies credit ratings will have a positive impact on
Tower
'
s profit in reducing the cost of present and future borrowings.
Given the acknowledged rigour of Standard and Poor
'
s evaluation
process, and the fact that this was the first time that the Tower
Group has been rated, Tower is pleased to have emerged so well.
"
 He
added that Tower will now seek to improve these ratings still further
in the years ahead.

NEWS RELEASE

Standard 
&
 Poor
'
s today assigned its 
'
A
'
 (strong) insurer financial
strength and counterparty credit ratings to the core operating
entities of the Tower Ltd group (Tower): Tower Life Australia Ltd
and Tower Life (New Zealand) Ltd. Tower Insurance Ltd
'
s 
'
A
'
 (strong)
insurer financial strength and counterparty credit ratings have been
affirmed. At the same time Standard 
&
 Poor
'
s assigned its 
'
BBB
'

(good) long-term and 
'
A-2
'
 short term counterparty credit ratings to
the group holding company, Tower Ltd, as well as the subsidiary
holding companies Tower Financial Services Group Ltd, and Tower
Holdings Australia Pty Ltd (see list below). The outlook on all
ratings is stable.

The ratings on the core operating and holding companies of Tower
(the first for the group) reflect the group
'
s excellent business
profile in New Zealand and emerging profile in Australia, and strong
operating performance and balance-sheet structure. Moderating
features include the highly competitive nature of the New Zealand and
Australian financial services sectors, which will challenge the Tower
group to continue to achieve greater efficiencies and scale of
operation.

Major rating factors: 

* Tower is one of the leading funds management, insurance and trustee
service providers in its home market of New Zealand, and holds the
number-one position in retail funds under management. More than 60%
of earnings are now generated by the Australian operations, which,
while growing quickly, do not hold the same strong market position as
the New Zealand operations. In the larger and higher growth
Australian market, Tower has assembled itself (through acquisition)
into a midsize life insurer, and in 1999 held the number-five
position in new annual and in-force premiums, with 8% and 6% market
shares, respectively. Across Australasia, Tower has a total of
NZ\$15.8 billion in funds under management (as at Sept 30, 1999),
having achieved a strong 29% average growth rate over the past five
years.

* A significant proportion of group income is generated by the
Australian life subsidiary, however, margins in this market have been
affected by competition and tax reform, which places greater pressure
on Tower to gain scale to support profitability into the future.

* Operating performance has been good, reflected in an operating
profit after tax of NZ\$73.1 million, and a return on average assets
of 1.7% based on pro forma accounts for 1999. Earnings in 2000 and
2001 are expected to benefit from synergies created by recent
acquisitions and internal restructuring.

* Capitalisation is strong within the core operating entities, as
evidenced by a solvency coverage of 1.8 times in the Australian life
subsidiary (the group
'
s largest operating subsidiary), which is
comparable with peers. Tower maintains an efficient balance sheet and
will use debt as a part of its structure. Gearing will be maintained
between 30%-40% and was 36% at March 31, 2000, combined with good
levels of interest coverage.

* Financial flexibility is good, supported by the group
'
s recent
listing. The lack of liquidity in Tower stock and price weakness,
however, may limit the group in the event of major capital needs.

The rating outlook is stable. Tower
'
s earnings are expected to grow
based on increasing revenues, internal restructuring, and synergies
expected from recent acquisitions. Standard 
&
 Poor
'
s expects that
Tower will continue to view acquisitions as a source of growth to
achieve greater efficiencies in scale of operation and meet
aggressive growth targets. A key challenge for Tower is to restore
the confidence in its distribution network in Australia in the face
of recent restructuring in the asset-management teams.

VIRAX HOLDINGS LIMITED

* Virax Holding Limited
'
s Co-X-Gene(TM) technology will be used to
  develop HIV vaccines

* Institute of Drug Technology (Australia) Limited will manufacture
  and test HIV vaccines in Virax
'
s facility; IDT will provide project
  management services to the consortium

Virax Holdings Limited (ASX:VHL) and Institute of Drug Technology
Australia Limited (ASX:IDT) today announced that, the Australian
consortium, of which they are a member, is to receive \$27 million
(US\$16) from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to fast track
the development and testing of vaccines to prevent HIV. Co-X-Gene(TM)
technology is to be used in these vaccines.

Today the Federal Minister for Health and Aged, Dr Michael
Wooldridge, and Federal Industry, Science and Resources Minister,
Senator Nick Minchin, announced the Australian consortium
'
s success.

HIV/AIDS is well recognised as a global emergency. More than 34
million people are living with HIV and 16 million men, women and
children having died. It has been estimated that 5.6 million people
were newly infected with HIV in 1999 and 95% of all new infections
are in developing countries. The current scientific consensus is that
the solution to HIV/AIDS will come via a vaccine.
                 
The NIH was particularly attracted to the Australian consortium
'
s
innovative 
'
prime and boost
'
 vaccine concept. The prime vaccine will
be DNA based. The boost vaccine will be based on FPV (fowlpox virus)
vaccine using Co-X-Gene(TM) technology licensed by Virax from
Australian National University and CSIRO. The vaccines will be used
in PhaseI/II clinical trials, initially in Australia and then in a
developing country. 
"
Our 
'
prime and boost
'
 concept is one of the most
promising approaches to a safe and effective HIV vaccine,
"
 said
Professor David Cooper, Program Director, National Centre in HIV
Epidemiology and Clinic Research (NCHECR).

Clinical trials using the developed vaccines will be managed by the
University of New South Wales through the NCHECR and the National
Centre in HIV Social Research (NCHSR).

Virax
'
s Co-X-Gene(TM) technology will be used to develop the boost
vaccines. The manufacturing and testing of boost vaccines will be
undertaken in Virax
'
s specialised GMP manufacturing facility by
Virax
'
s strategic partner, IDT. IDT has used its world ranking
expertise to develop the necessary technical capability for such
manufacture and testing. The costs of the manufacturing and testing
are fully reimbursable under the contract award. Virax has rights to
commercialise vaccines developed from the initiative.

Virax CEO, Dr David Beames, said, 
"
This is an excellent demonstration
of how, by the collaboration of private and public entities, we can
maximize the efforts of Australia to fight to prevent HIV.


"
These prevention clinical trials provide another opportunity for
Virax to prove the utility of its Co-X-Gene(TM) platform technology.
These prevention trials will compliment the company
'
s treatment
clinical trial which is scheduled to commence later this year,
"

continued Dr Beames.

IDT Chairman and Managing Director, Dr Graeme Blackman, said, 
"
This
award is very important for Australia in its advance to developing
the capacity to take scientific discoveries through to
commercialisation. The level of collaboration is an important element
in this process and we believe that, with Virax, IDT can make a major
contribution to a successful outcome for this consortium.
"
"
IDT has a proven record in manufacture and this project will further
enhance the Company
'
s expertise. The project management aspects will
also be a challenging task, but one, I believe, is within IDT
'
s
competence
"
 he added.

In this unique NIH contract, the consortium had to provide a clear
development plan, including timelines to indicate when different
phases would be completed. Funding is to be provided in increments as
preset milestones are reached over a five-year period.

Institute of Drug Technology Australia Limited (ASX:IDT) is a
publicly listed Australian pharmaceutical manufacturing and drug
development company. The Company also provides a comprehensive range
of research and development, consultancy, and analytical services to
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.

IDT has manufacturing facilities and laboratories in Melbourne and is

Melbourne-based Virax Holdings Limited is a publicly listed
(ASX:VHL) biotechnology company engaged in immunotherapeutics for

WEBJET LIMITED
Adelaide
The year ended June 30, 2000 saw the transition from Roper River
Resources NL (a mining company) to Webjet Ltd, an internet based
travel manager and marketer, and as such the year
'
s results include
now discontinued mining activities, the transition of the company,
and the last quarter operations as Webjet.

RESULT

The year
'
s results are therefore comprised of: 

Roper River mining activities loss           \$ 958,421 
Webjet operating loss                        \$ 539,869 
Total loss                                  \$1,498,290 

Of the Webjet operating loss of \$539,869, brand building accounted
for some \$183,722, leaving a core operating loss of \$356,147.

All development expenditure in the quarter ended June 30, 2000
including the total brand establishment costs and site development
costs have been fully expensed and written off to the profit and loss
account, so that the result is stated in the most conservative
manner.

It should also be noted that due to a lead time between customer
enquiry, quotation and booking, and ultimately final ticketing at
which point revenue is brought to account, the period ended June 30,
2000 includes a large component of cost where revenue will be
recognised in subsequent periods. It is estimated that the lead time
ranges between 60 days and 90 days from point of initial enquiry and
final ticketing.

Webjet Ltd finished the financial year June 30, 2000 with cash
reserves of \$5.27 million, which the Board considers sufficient to
pursue its business plan in a manner which should enable your company
to build a substantial ongoing revenue base and take advantage of
development opportunities as they arise over the next few years.

WEBJET
'
S BUSINESS

Unlike a number of travel and internet operations which are a mixture
of traditional street front travel agencies with websites, telephone
call centres with websites, and other hybrid arrangements, Webjet is
a pure internet marketer and manager of travel, and as a consequence
has developed a business model with a fundamental cost base which we
believe will enable us to deliver the consumer substantial price
advantages and deliver our shareholders ongoing transaction profits.
 
The result is that our semi-fixed cost structure in the year 2000-01
(excluding brand build cost) is expected to be approximately \$1.6
million with an anticipated brand build cost in 2000-01 of
approximately \$800,000.

STRATEGY

These fundamental strategies of low cost distribution, outsourcing
resulting in low fixed cost component, and the utilisation of the
internet to obtain immediacy of offer communication is central to the
ongoing developments of your company.

During the last six months a number of the world
'
s major carriers
have publicly announced strategies of a similar type. These include
British Airways, which is now on public record as stating that it
intends to achieve 50% of its revenue from the internet over the next
five years and in the local market Qantas, which recently announced
the intended establishment of a multi-airline internet platform. More
recently it has been reinforced and validated by Impulse Airlines
'

decision to effectively distribute and sell its products over the
internet.

Already in North America all of the major carriers have established
major internet distribution platforms, which for example in the case
of South West Airlines, accounts for over 16% of the airline
'
s
revenue base.

Webjet welcomes these developments. They will result in an increased
consumer use of the internet for the facilitation of travel,
increased consumer confidence in the internet as a medium to obtain
the latest and best product offers and prices and will result in an
acceleration of technological progress in areas such as booking
engines, fare searches, and critically, customer service.

These developments represent a sound endorsement and validation of
the fundamental Webjet business plan.

KEY INDICATORS

This report contains a number of key indicator graphs which cover the
period from our effective commercial launch at the beginning of April
to current date.

These include: 
GRAPH ONE 
Which tabulates Webjet
'
s travel site rankings in the Australian
industry and shows conclusively that our advertising brand build has
been astonishingly successful to the extent that your company has
achieved Number One site ranking on a number of occasions, placing it
ahead of the national carrier Qantas and all of its commercial
non-airline competitors on a consistent basis.

GRAPH TWO 
The weekly quotations trend analysis shows an approximate 300%
increase in weekly quotations as measured in the above period.

GRAPH THREE 
The weekly site sessions graph shows a consistently high and
progressively building level of general site activity. 

GRAPH FOUR 
The gross revenue trend analysis, noting that there is a lead time
between enquiry, quotation, booking, and revenue production, shows an
over 400% increase on a weekly basis from the beginning of April to
the middle of August (estimate in final week graphed).

GRAPH FIVE 
Quotations and Booking Trend Analysis shows a consistent trend
between actual bookings and quotations, the underlying conversion
increase from approximately 4% to approximately 6%.

The combination of these trend indicators give us a high degree of
confidence that our business strategy and plan is soundly based and
so far working according to schedule.

FORECASTS

As demonstrated above, all of our current key indicators are
positive, and in some cases quite dramatic.

There are of course a number of uncertainties, risks, and lead time
issues which are extremely difficult to quantify or predict. These
include, amongst other things: 

1. The Olympic Games period, which may distort travel patterns and
   bookings,
2. General economic activity post GST,
3. Airline price initiatives and market stimulation exercises,
4. The Australian dollar and its impact on outbound tourism and
   inbound tourism

And underlying these macro issues, the lead time in the establishment
of brand values and ultimate booking activity with an additional
uncertainty relating to the exact timing of the e Commerce consumer
explosion which is being predicted.

Given our early stage in development, it is therefore extremely
difficult for your Board to undertake detailed commercial forecasts,
but we nevertheless consider it appropriate to relate our current
expectations to our prospectus forecast application of funds which
envisaged a net application of funds in the year ended June 2001 of
some \$4.6 million.

Our current expectation is that net funds application in this period
will be limited to approximately \$2 million which is less than half
the original estimates. 

This is a product of: 

1. Reduced but more effective advertising and marketing,
2. Tightly controlled operating expenditure,
3. Leveraged product and alliance marketing, 
4. Better than expected revenue trends.

As already noted at the end of June 2000 your company has
approximately \$5.2 million cash reserves with no debt, and relative
to these forecasts has sufficient financial capacity to appropriately
pursue its business plan.
