ADELAIDE BRIGHTON LIMITED
Adelaide
The company has changed considerably since I last wrote to you.
Adelaide Brighton now has a different structure with the acquisition
of Cockburn Cement and the purchase of 49% of Adelaide Brighton
Cement previously owned by Australian Cement. The Rugby Group PLC who
helped facilitate these transactions had their 55% shareholding in
Adelaide Brighton taken over by RMC Group plc. RMC is a major
international building materials company based in the United Kingdom
and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its business includes the
production of ready mixed concrete and concrete products, aggregates,
cement and lime. It is the world
'
s largest supplier of ready mixed
concrete.

The Board appointed a new Managing Director, Phil Wright, at the end
of last year and he has built a new team within the company which is
energetically focused on an improved management strategy. Those four
directors representing Rugby
'
s interests have retired from the Board
and three new members representing the RMC Group have been appointed.

MARKET CONDITIONS

Your company has had to contend with the price depression caused by
dumped imports. This is at a time when the industry is itself coming
off the high volumes of the past two years, as recent interest rate
rises and the GST take effect, and government infrastructure spending
slows. The results to June 2000 demonstrate the management team has
had some success in offsetting these events.

PROGRESS

I can assure all shareholders that our company is in the best shape
it has been in for many years. Phil Wright and his team are starting
to see the results of their pursuit of improved operational
effectiveness, and reduction of waste. Their mission is to be a 
'
well
run, profitable operation by June 2001
'
 and among the best in the
world by 2005.

We are a different company:

* The Rugby transaction doubled the size of Adelaide Brighton
'
s (ABL)
  business. ABL is Australia
'
s largest producer of cement and lime 
  with operations in all mainland states;

* The acquisition of Cockburn Cement gave your company access to a
  significant cement business and provided it with the dominant market
  position in lime in Australia. This has diversified ABL
'
s earning
  base and provides better opportunities for growth in the future;

* The result to 30 June 2000 exceeds the forecast at the time of the
  Rugby transaction, once the affect of imports (some \$24 million) is
  taken into account;

* Birkenhead in the 12 months to June 2000 has returned its best
  production performance in three years - and continues to improve; 
  and 

* ABL
'
s balance sheet is the strongest it has been for ten years.
  Further progress is expected with capital expenditure being kept to 
  a minimum and the company continuing to generate strong cash flows.

IMPORTS

Dumping is where product is exported for less than its manufacture
cost in its home country. The issue of imports at dumped prices is
very significant to ABL and the cement industry in Australia.
Although Customs found dumping was occurring from Indonesia, Thailand
and Malaysia, it has as yet been unable to determine the same from
China.

We believe the Customs inquiry in relation to China to be
fundamentally flawed and are vigorously pursuing this issue with
government. We remain optimistic of a successful outcome.

DIVIDEND

Your directors have followed the decline in our share price with
great concern and believe the company to be grossly undervalued.

There is no doubt we are a stronger company than we have been for
many years although our share price is considerably lower now than in
the past. The new management team is demonstrating real progress and
we continue to enjoy excellent relations with our major shareholder,
RMC, whose practical support has assisted greatly in the advances to
date. 

We are pleased to declare an interim dividend of 1.5 cents per share
fully franked. 

Although this utilises all of our existing franking credits the Board
believes that their value should be returned to shareholders now.
Management is investigating all options, that subject to trading
conditions, will allow tax effective distributions to shareholders in
the future.

OUTLOOK

Market conditions will remain difficult this next year and many are
forecasting severe declines in residential building activity and
little indication of government spending post Olympics. This will
impact on our earnings and we expect them not to match the last 12
months, but the company is far better prepared to weather this
downturn in the cycle and position itself for any change upward.

Thank you for your ongoing commitment.

NEWS RELEASE 

ANGLOGOLD SELLS ITS DEELKRAAL AND ELANDSRAND MINES TO HARMONY FOR
R1 BILLION

AngloGold Limited has announced that it has reached agreement in
principle on the sale of two of its South African gold mines,
Elandsrand and Deelkraal, to Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited for
R1 billion in cash.

The transaction is subject to the
fulfilment of the following suspensive conditions:

handover of the assets.

Elandsrand came into production in 1978 with an anticipated life to
2001. The subsequent commissioning of the sub-vertical shaft in 1984
and the acquisition of Deelkraal from Gold Fields in 1997 (which
allowed access to further reserves) extended this life significantly.

Elandsrand has been and continues to be one of AngloGold
'
s labour
productivity flagships. Changes in mining method and work structure
have led to some of the highest levels of labour productivity in the
gold industry. These improvements have been sustained over time and
have now also been spread broadly throughout AngloGold
'
s operations.
However, Elandsrand is now in a mature stage of its life and is
experiencing declining grades, resulting in a decline in
profitability.

Management and the Board have carefully evaluated the offer made for
these two assets, and have determined that a higher return on capital
can be achieved by accepting the Harmony offer and investing the cash
in other major projects.

AngloGold Chairman and CEO, Bobby Godsell said: 


"
These disposals are consistent with AngloGold
'
s strategy of
concentrating on higher margin, long life operations through
accelerated asset re-alignments. The transaction should reduce the
company
'
s cash costs to \$197/oz and total costs to \$237/oz on a
consolidated basis and will have a positive impact on AngloGold
'
s
earnings. It will also reduce AngloGold
'
s annual gold production from
South African sources by approximately 500,000 ounces. With respect
to AngloGold
'
s remaining South African operations, it should reduce
cash costs to \$208/oz and total costs to \$233/oz.
"


The sale also reduces AngloGold
'
s capital commitments in South Africa
by R730 million over the next six years.

Harmony will assume operational control of Deelkraal and Elandsrand
from 1 February 2001.

S ADDRESS 

Welcome to the third Annual General Meeting of Prophecy International
Holdings Limited. I am pleased once again to be able to address this
meeting and report on the activity of the company for the past year.

The Prophecy business entered its twentieth year of trading this year
and we are all very proud of our long history of software development
and the support of innovative enterprise wide business solutions
suitable for the global market. Our dedicated staff are committed to
the continuous enhancement and evolution of our unique products and
are determined to see them prosper in the corporate market space.

The year just completed has been one of consolidation for the Group.
The total number of shareholders has continued to increase and now
stands at over 1600. This I believe demonstrates market confidence in
our future. Towards the end of the last calendar year we considerably
strengthened our Balance Sheet position and placed 3 million shares
with Institutional shareholders to raise some 12 million dollars to
add to the working capital of the Group. As a result the Group is in
a very strong cash position and is able to invest in the further
enhancement of its technology and the expansion of its sales
activities world-wide.

The overall result for the year just completed came in two very much
contrasting halves. Our products are aimed at the large corporate and
government marketplace world-wide. As a result of Y2K fears buyers
in these markets to a large degree sat on their hands during the
course of the first half, resulting in a substantial slowdown in
orders for our products. We saw as a consequence a low revenue figure
and a sizeable loss for that first half. This was a disappointing
result. However, the second half saw a return to business as usual
after the world did not end on the 1st of January. We achieved a
record result for the second half with Revenues of 10.3 million
dollars and an after tax profit of 2.5 million dollars, beating the
previous best half being 7.5 million dollars in revenue. The slow
first half however saw the overall result for the year at 12.8
million in revenue and an after tax loss of 382 thousand. The result
would have been a profit for the year had the figures not included a
provision for doubtful debts.

Our balance sheet remains very strong with total assets at 21.6
million, total liabilities at 4 million and net assets at 17.6
million. This gives a net asset backing of 38.8 cents per share on
the expanded number of shares after the placement. As the vast
majority of our development of Intellectual Property has historically
been expensed, the considerable value of our intellectual property
does not appear on the balance sheet. On this basis we believe that
markets currently are undervaluing our Company. The record second
half result demonstrates the potential of our solutions and is the
pointer to the capabilities of our business in this financial year.

We have secured a number of important contracts that place a stamp of
approval on our unique e-Foundation Rapid Application Assembly
environment which combines our Framework software with core modules
ready to implement a tailored solution and deploy that solution via
the internet. A few examples include the Asset Finance division of
the ANZ Banking Group, the Colorado State Government and the internet
travel company Bye Bye Now. The ANZ for instance is utilising our
E-Foundation technology to develop a sophisticated tailored solution
to drive all aspects of their Asset Finance Division business.

The major benefits being derived by our clients are a saving in time
and money on the development of large business solutions and the
flexibility in being able to rapidly adjust those solutions as the
market demands over their life. The ANZ deal is one of the largest
that we have concluded and will earn considerable revenues for the
Company over the life of the solution as well as provide an excellent
reference for the capabilities of our unique e-Foundation offering.

Our future lies in providing large scale tailored e-Business
solutions such as this to large corporates and government departments
around the world. We utilise the latest in object-oriented Java
technology to further develop our solutions, keeping them unique in
their ability to provide modern systems for business competitiveness.
We have invested in our own expanded salesforce to take our
e-Foundation solutions to markets in all of our territories.
Additionally we continue to focus sales activity on partnerships
across the world to provide exponential growth potential through the
leverage of the sales and marketing operations of large partners. We
see this as strategically very important. On the back of recent large
e-Foundation deals we are taking the opportunity to expand our
consulting revenues. New staff have been added in recent months to
grow our consulting team and the scope for expansion of revenues in
this area is large indeed.

To contribute to our future success we at Prophecy are committed to
supporting the development and wellbeing of all of our staff
throughout our global operations. Over the last 12 months we have
actively recruited staff within the areas of development, support,
sales and marketing such that our dedicated global team of 90 staff
gives us the capacity to reach our corporate objectives. I would
like to thank all the staff of Prophecy as their efforts do make the
difference.

In conclusion, I would like to thank you the shareholders for your
continuing support of the Company and look forward to seeing you
again at next year

DEVINE LIMITED
Brisbane
The Directors of Devine Limited are pleased to announce that loan
facilities required for the construction of the company
'
s River Place
apartment project have been formally approved by the company
'
s
bankers, the ANZ Banking Group Limited. Following this, Multiplex
Constructions Pty Ltd have been appointed as the builder for the 
38 level tower development.

River Place is a \$123.5M residential apartment development on the
Brisbane River in the Brisbane CBD. When commenced, the 311 unit
development will be the largest residential project under
construction in Brisbane. The market acceptance of the project can be
demonstrated by the exceptional level of sales achieved on the
project prior to the commencement of construction. At the end of
October, 87% of the units had been sold and unconditional contracts
with 10% deposit paid were held for 77% of the total 311 units.

Work on the site is expected to start within the next two weeks with
construction scheduled to be completed in the June quarter of 2002.

Directors are confident that the project will make a material
contribution to the company
'
s results in financial years 2000/2001
and 2001/2002.

ARROWFIELD GROUP LIMITED

CHAIRMAN
'
S LETTER

Dear Shareholder

On behalf of the board, I submit this information memorandum to you.

The board is seeking your approval to a selective capital reduction
under which all shares in the Company other than those held by myself
and two companies I control will be cancelled. Shareholders whose
shares are cancelled will receive \$3.00 per share.

The consideration to be paid by the Company is regarded as fair and
reasonable by the Board and is higher than the Company
'
s shares have
traded for since 1987. The consideration to be paid by the Company
has been determined after taking into consideration the likely net
realisation value of the Company
'
s assets.

To implement this transaction, two shareholders
'
 meetings are to be
held. The first meeting is of all shareholders but at which votes
cast in favour by any person whose shares are to be cancelled will be
disregarded. The second meeting is of only those shareholders whose
shares are being cancelled. Each meeting must pass the resolutions by
75% majority. The meetings will be held on the same day, the second
immediately following the first.

If the resolutions are passed and the selective capital reduction is
implemented, shareholders whose shares are being cancelled will
receive \$3.00 per share within 21 days following the meetings.

The Company engaged HLB Mann Judd Corporate (NSW) Pty Ltd (
"
HLB Mann
Judd
"
) to provide an independent expert
'
s report as to the fairness
and reasonableness of the proposed selective capital reduction from
the perspective of all of the Company
'
s shareholders. HLB Mann Judd
concluded that the proposed selective capital reduction is fair and
reasonable to the Company
'
s expropriated shareholders and those
shareholders who remain.

The directors of the Company recommend that you carefully consider
this explanatory memorandum

EXPLORATION

Dalgaranga - Tantalum (ATE 100% and option to purchase 100%)

Announcements regarding exploration and development progress were
released on the 2 June and 9 June 2000 respectively. Since the
release of these updates Australasian has continued the program of
metallurgical test work, the associated pilot plant study and
additional RC drilling at Tantalus. A decision on the pilot plant
establishment is due to be made next week after the final
metallurgical results are available. 

Reverse circulation drilling was completed at Tantalus with a further
7 holes (DFC 19-26) drilled for an advance of 278m. The drilling was
designed to determine the down-dip and southern extension of the
tantalum-bearing pegmatite. Geological interpretation of the drill
holes indicates the pegmatite extends at least a further 200 metres
south and is open although a change in strike to a southeasterly
direction is evident. Further RC drilling is planned in August to
test the pegmatite to the south and down dip to a vertical depth of
about 100 metres.

Estimation of the resources of tantalum bearing pegmatite at
Dalgaranga and Tantalus is in progress.

Meekatharra - Hope River (ATE 100%)

A further 25 inclined reverse circulation holes (MHC 19-43) for 2453m
of a 32 hole program have been drilled on traverses spaced at 80 and
160 metres along a strike extent of 1840 metres. The program was
designed to locate the extension of the mineralised shear zone in at
least one hole on each section to aid geological interpretation. Five
diamond drill holes (MHD44-48) were completed for a total of 1022
metres and were designed to test the primary mineralisation beneath
the RC fences at about 130 metres vertical depth.

Mineralisation intersected in the diamond holes is associated with
silica-chlorite-sulphide-carbonate alteration with associated quartz
veins hosted by a shear zone up to 70 metres in length down hole.
Sulphides occupy up to 15% of the rock in some intervals over 4 to 5
metres in length and include chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrrhotite and
pyrite. Assays are awaited.

Once assays are received and interpreted it is planned to complete
down hole EM geophysical surveys to determine the extent of the
sulphide mineralisation and to define targets for further drill
testing.

CORPORATE FINANCE FACILITY

In recognition of the increase in the level of country risk now faced
by the Company due to the location of its only producing mine in
Indonesia, the lending banks under the Corporate Finance Facility
requested and the Company agreed to a restructure of the amortisation
schedule under the Facility loan documentation.

The original amortisation schedule required loan repayments of US$15
million on 31 December 1999, US$10 million on 31 December 2000 and
the remaining US$5 million on 31 December 2001. In terms of the
revised amortisation schedule, the US$7 million of debt under the
Corporate Finance Facility not cash collateralised is to be repaid
as to US$1.75 million on 31 December 1999 (now completed) and three
further instalments of US$1.75 million each on 31 March 2000, 30 June
2000 and 30 September 2000. Settlement of the cash collateralised
component of US$23 million will be completed by setoff by 1 January
2001.

DEVELOPMENT - MT MURO

PERMATA BATU BADINDING HULUBAI (PBH) DEPOSIT - RESOURCE UPDATE

A detailed review of the resource based on the reconciliation history
for this deposit resulted in a re-interpretation of dilution applied
to the model. The 3D geological model was revised to exclude the
dilution skin previously applied to the vein interpretation.

Gold and silver grades were estimated for the veins using ordinary
kriging of top-cut (if required) 1m downhole composite data
constrained to the interpreted vein outlines expanded to a minimum
mining width if necessary.

The in situ mineral resource is: - 

DEPOSIT         CATEGORY              1.4 g/t AuEq CUTOFF
                                M TONNES     Au g/t      Ag g/t
---------------------------------------------------------------
PBH             Measured        1.0          3.8         135
                Indicated       0.7          2.7          97
                Inferred        -            -           -
                Total           1.7          3.3         119

Note: due to rounding total numbers may not reflect individual
columns

The result represents some 279,000 ozAuEq, a significant decrease in
contained metal compared to the 481,000 ozAuEq previously reported.
This decrease is due to the removal of the dilution skin from the
hardrock resource (160,000 ozAuEq) and the re-interpretation of the
eluvial resource (42,000 oz AuEq).

PERMATA BATU BADINDING HULUBAI DEPOSIT - RESERVE UPDATE

The new resource with its tighter constraints has led to an increase
in ore reserves based on optimisation using current mining and
processing cost parameters and metal prices of US$300/oz gold and
US$5.50/oz Silver. A new 6 stage pit development schedule was
established with the new reserve at the end of December 1999 being:

DEPOSIT         CATEGORY              1.4 g/t AuEq CUTOFF
                                TONNES       Au g/t      Ag g/t
---------------------------------------------------------------
PBH             Proved          535,000      4.40        143
                Probable        188,000      3.74        122
                Total           722,000      4.23        138

Note: due to rounding total numbers may not reflect individual
columns

The result is an increase of approximately 15,000 oz AuEq on the
previously reported reserve.

DEVELOPMENT - TOKA TINDUNG PROJECT - NORTH SULAWESI (AURORA 85%)

* DEVELOPMENT GEOLOGY

TOKA TINDUNG DEPOSIT - RESOURCE UPDATE

Delineation drilling covering the southern Stage 1 pit and straddling
the deepest part of the ultimate pit was completed at the Toka
Tindung deposit early in 1999. The additional drilling totalled
3,400m of RC in 34 holes and 540m of HQ diamond in three holes.

A detailed review of the structural data and geological model of the
deposit, including re-logging of RC chip-trays and diamond holes was
then undertaken prior to a full re-interpretation of the deposit.
The 3D geological model was revised based on the results from 190
diamond holes and 422 RC percussion holes and the re-interpretation.
The new model defined 61 discrete veins and incorporated revised
interpretations of lithology, alteration and oxidation zones, and
structures.

Gold and silver grades were estimated for the veins using ordinary
kriging or, if insufficient numbers of composites, mean grade of
top-cut (if required) 1m downhole composite data constrained to the
interpreted vein outlines expanded to a minimum mining width if
necessary. Gold grades for the stockwork zones (between the defined
veins) was estimated by multiple indicator kriging and silver grades
by median indicator kriging. Specific gravity was assigned by rock
type, weathering and alteration based on over 1,000 density
measurements.

The in situ mineral resource is: -

DEPOSIT         CATEGORY              1.0 g/t AuEq CUTOFF
                                M TONNES     Au g/t      Ag g/t
---------------------------------------------------------------
Toka Tindung    Measured        1.7          3.5         7
                Indicated       6.2          2.7         5
                Inferred        0.2          1.5         2
                Total           8.1          2.8         6

Note: due to rounding total numbers may not reflect individual
columns

The result represents some 766,000 ozAuEq, a significant increase in
contained metal compared to the 686,000 ozAuEq previously reported.
This increase is due to the improved structural understanding gained
from infill drilling, re-logging and the geological re-
interpretation leading to the definition of additional discrete veins
and increased confidence in their strike and dip continuity.

Reserve reassessments for Toka Tindung will be announced in the March
2000

AUSTAR UNITED COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED
Sydney
Seven Network Limited and Austar United Communications today signed
an agreement which will see the network
'
s C7 Sports subscription
television Olympic channels delivered to Austar
'
s subscribers in
regional Australia.

The deal ensures the best possible coverage of the Sydney Olympics
will be available to subscribers to Austar
'
s digital satellite
service and Darwin
'
s cable service. Viewers as far away from Sydney
as Whyalla and Townsville will be able to enjoy the action from the
Games as they happen.

In addition to its planned broadcast television coverage of the Games
of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney, Seven will produce two channels for
subscription television. These channels will feature more than 750
hours of continuous coverage of most events at the Olympic Games -
complementing the 24 hour a day broadcast television coverage on the
Seven Network.

Austar is the leading providing of multichannel television in
regional Australia serving one third of Australia
'
s homes. Austar
delivers its service with a combination of digital satellite, HFC
cable and fixed wireless technologies. Austar currently offers C7
sport as part of its 32 channel lineup.

Details of the agreement were released today by Mr Kerry Stokes,
Executive Chairman, Seven Network Limited, and Mr John Porter, Chief
Executive Officer, Austar United Communications Limited.

Commenting, Mr Stokes said: 
"
We are delighted to partner Austar in
bringing our Olympic sports channels to more than 1 million viewers
throughout regional Australia. Our plans for subscription television
coverage of the Olympic Games include more than 750 hours of sports
coverage complementing our broadcast television programming. We
believe our C7 Sports coverage of the Olympic Games will provide
compelling viewing on subscription television.
"


Commenting, Mr Porter said: 
"
The Olympic Games will clearly be the
big event for 2000 and we are pleased that, with C7, we will be able
to bring them to our subscribers. We believe that it is important for
all Australians to participate in the excitement of the Olympics,
especially those who are unable to be in Sydney for the Games
themselves. We know that our subscribers love sport. C7 has proved
very popular. We are confident that the Olympics package will be a
real winner.
"


Under the agreement, Austar will make available two channels on the
company
'
s digital satellite direct-to-home platform and its cable
network in Darwin. Seven and Austar are undertaking negotiations on
the possible expansion of the Olympic channels agreement to encompass
delivery on Austar
'
s MDS platform.

The two channels will focus on long-form programming, crossing to a
venue and providing complete uninterrupted coverage of an event. A
primary focus of both channels will be complete coverage of sports
such as hockey, basketball and tennis.

The production of the two Olympic channels, in addition to the
broadcast television coverage on the Seven Network, represents the
single largest project ever undertaken on Australian television. In
total more than 400 people will produce for the Seven Network and C7
more than 1,200 hours of live television coverage during the 17 days
of the Games of the XXVII Olympiad.

A key element of i7 is C7, which produces sports channels for
subscription television and broadband delivery. C7 is planning the
creation of news, finance, movies and entertainment channels for
subscription television and broadband distribution. C7 produces and
supplies sports channels on the Optus and Austar subscription
television platforms.

Odyssey channel on Optus and Sky News Australia on all three pay
television platforms (Foxtel, Austar and Optus). i7, through C7, has
strategic investments in Access1 and Evolution Technologies which
will deliver C7 subscription television channels on computer screens.

i7, and its partners, including NBCi, will provide consumers with a
broad-ranging and highly-meshed network of complementary 
"
best of
breed
"
 content streams. Other notable features of the i7 Network will
include case of navigation and an innovative use of authoring and
distribution technology - with an objective of providing the best
possible user experience. Equally, i7 plans to provide consumers with
a secure environment, protective both of their transactions and
personal information.

BENDIGO BANK LIMITED
Melbourne
CHAIRMAN
'
S ADDRESS - BY CHAIRMAN, RICHARD A GUY (OAM)

This morning I bade you 
"
welcome to Bendigo
"
.

I should add welcome to Tambellup, Innisfail, Oak Flats, Goomalling,
Port Douglas, South Grafton and all the other far-flung communities
which have joined our network in the past year. Although they might
not be represented here today, these communities have a very real
stake in our Bank. They are our Customers, our Shareholders and,
equally importantly, our ambassadors.

I doubt anyone in these communities would even have heard of Bendigo
Bank two years ago, yet today we serve them all. In those two years,
we have broadened our horizons - and we are branching out further
afield.

Our merger with Queensland
'
s First Australian Building Society was a
significant post balance date event - indeed it is one of the most
significant developments in our 142 years and our biggest in dollar
value. Until First Australian, our interstate presence bordered on
tokenism.

Five years ago we had only one interstate branch - and that just over
the river, in Albury. Cassa Commerciale and Community Bank helped
grow that number to 17 by last month. Today, however, we have 64
interstate outlets with the likelihood of a further 15 or so by this
time next year, including our first Tasmanian branches. We will then
be represented in every state of Australia.

And although our brand will not be visible, we are also represented
in a further 240 communities which host outlets of our fledgling
joint venture, Elders Rural Bank.

Bendigo is a bank with a growing national presence.

Enter a taxi anywhere in Australia and mention you are with Bendigo
Bank and there is a good chance the driver will engage you in
conversation about the virtues of Community Bank.

Clearly we have struck a chord which is resonating across Australia.
More and more communities are attracted to the value proposition we
bring to banking - that successful customers and successful
communities create a successful bank. This is creating boundless
opportunity for us - indeed one of our main challenges is to govern
our growth to ensure we can manage it well.

In short, we are becoming relevant to more people and more
communities across this great nation.

We are also becoming more relevant to customers as we expand the
services we provide. August last year saw Bendigo and our alliance
partner IOOF launch Bendigo Investment Services, a financial planning
arm offering independent advice at branch level to complement the
specialist service provided by Worley Securities in Melbourne. Our
initiative with IOOF has been embraced by customers to the point
where we approach half-a-billion dollars under advice in little over
a year.

Our trustee company, Sandhurst Trustees, will this year feel the
impact of changes to the Corporations Law which will reduce the scope
for independent trustee work. These changes had been anticipated and
Sandhurst is developing alternative income streams, in part through
wholesaling its recently revamped superannuation plan affording
customers unprecedented choice of investments. This product, and the
Sandhurst Australian Industrial Share Fund launched this year, enable
our customers to make a wide range of investments, all under our
Company
'
s umbrella. This broadens our ability to help our customers
achieve their financial aims.

We believe being relevant in this way is one of the three major
ingredients essential to our future.

(The other two are performance and prospects and I will return to
those shortly.) The more relevant we are to those communities we
serve, the more likely we are to be their chosen banker.

This is a major rationale behind projects such as Community Telco,
our Regional Development Fund and Lead On with which we are involved.
These projects increase our relevance; they also improve the
prospects of these communities succeeding, and the more success they
enjoy, the greater our rewards.

Bendigo Bank is becoming more relevant to Australia
'
s farming
community through our joint venture company Elders Rural Bank. Farm
banking products designed and administered by our Bank are being
introduced nationwide through 240 Elders outlets. The company
'
s
banking authority took effect from 27 June this year .. and to
immediate effect. Such was the inflow of new deposit funds to the new
bank that it achieved its yearly budgeted deposit growth in just two
months. Bank status will clearly enable Elders Rural Bank to
accelerate its support for the agribusiness sector.

We are relevant to more investors. More shareholders than ever have a
stake in our Company, with a further 10,000 - mostly Queenslanders -
joining our register from First Australian. This means our company is
now effectively one-quarter owned by Queenslanders, who also
contribute about one-quarter of our business as well. This
shareholder / customer nexus ensures we are relevant in this new
market and enhances our prospects of success.

When converting to a bank just five years ago we had 8500
shareholders - we are now owned by 34,000 mainly individual
shareholders. There is little doubt our philosophies are supported by
our shareholders. Our stock is tightly held and trading volumes
remained thin even when our price spiked to six dollars and beyond.
Shareholders want us to succeed through bringing to Australians a
style of banking which aims to help customers attain their financial
goals.

... which brings me to the second factor essential to our future -
our performance.

You are all aware that our otherwise excellent performance during
the past financial year was marred by the need to provision for a
large, one-off loan exposure in Asia. Naturally, we would all prefer
this event had not happened, but it is important to view it in the
context of our business.

We are in the business of lending money under prudential guidelines.
Sometimes, however, even prudence fails to guarantee the return of
our funds. In this instance, the default was large, but write-offs of
bad loans are a regular part of banking business.

It is important that Shareholders understand the background of this
transaction. Before being approved, this loan was subjected to due
process of evaluation by Bendigo. Although this was not our normal
style of loan, the company concerned was a well-respected, investment
-grade rated international manufacturer with a sound history and a
strong relationship with Monte Paschi Australia (which we acquired in
1997). The company continued to meet its payment obligations to us
and there were no warning signs prior to it experiencing
difficulties. Even ratings agencies did not signal any problems right
up to the firm
'
s unexpected demise.

Bendigo was one of many banks which provided facilities to this
company and the other Australian and international banks, too, have
suffered losses.

This issue is of great concern to shareholders, as evidenced by the
number of questions received in response to the invitation issued
with your Notice of Meeting.

We are determined not to repeat this experience. This loan was unique
in style, structure and size but was relationship-based. An
examination of the Group
'
s commercial loan portfolio has determined
that our overall credit quality is sound and that there are are no
other similar loans.

By provisioning this year for the amount assessed as unrecoverable,
we have confined the impact on profit to 1999/2000. We have reviewed
our larger corporate loans, and have a clear balance sheet going
forward.

But while there will be no further impact on profit, the episode will
remain imprinted on our corporate memory as a reaffirmation of the
need for the sound credit policies which have enabled this company to
weather the storms and tempests of the past 142 years.

On a positive note, it is a measure of our resilience that we can
absorb such a hefty blow in one year and yet still record an after-
tax profit increase of 8.2 per cent on the previous year.

Given that the abnormal item has been dealt with, though, it is our
underlying performance on which shareholders should focus, for it
provides a better indication of the Bank
'
s true performance. Our pre-
tax profit growth of 61.8 per cent, to \$47.9 million, was quite
outstanding.

This result was built on the foundations of a substantial increase in
earnings. Revenue grew by almost 28 per cent as we began to reap the
rewards of our investment program and the various alliances we have
forged in recent years.

New loan approvals totalled \$1.85 billion a figure all-the-more-
impressive because it is larger than our total asset base when
converting to a bank just five years ago. Total assets then were
\$1.68 billion.

(One man who I know will be impressed with \$1850 million in loans is
our Len Holland, who vividly recalls cracking a bottle of - cheap -
champagne when Sandhurst Building Society wrote a million dollars
worth of loans in a year. We currently write that much business in a
little over an hour.)

Our assets now, including those brought to us by First Australian,
total more than \$6.5 billion and we are Australia
'
s ninth-largest
bank as measured by assets. We expect assets to be close to \$7
billion by the end of this financial year.

Retail deposits continue to be a key driver of our success. It is
becoming ever more difficult for banks to attract deposits away from
fund management yet we were able to grow retail deposits by 22 per
cent and so maintain our core funding. By sourcing 80-plus per cent
of our funds from our own depositors, we are able to reduce our
dependence on wholesale money and so contain our cost of funds and
maintain our margins.

At the same time, we are mindful of the growing demand for funds
management and other products and so continue to diversify our
offerings. Non-interest income from these and other sources now
comprises one-third of our total revenue, meaning we are less
vulnerable to any squeeze on interest margins.

Further protection is afforded by the increasing diversity of our
loan portfolio - our eggs are no longer in just one basket.

Notwithstanding the abnormal provision, asset quality remains sound.
The chart behind me shows impaired loans as a percentage of total
loans and illustrates how well our asset quality compares with
industry standards. The grey line represents our position if one
ignores the abnormal, and even including it - the orange line - we
are still on a par with our competitors. These are low levels of
impaired loans and we have seen no deterioration, even despite the
round of interest rate increases we have seen over the past year or
so.

Asset quality is critical, but prudence - and our regulator, APRA -
also demands that we provision against the possibility of loans
defaulting. The year just passed saw us finally reach a milestone in
building our general provision to the benchmark figure of 0.5 per
cent of risk weighted assets. Attaining this preferred level will
assist our profitability, since provisions are effectively a charge
against our bottom line. For the past few years, we have not only had
to gradually build that ratio but have had to provide for our
evergrowing loans portfolio at the same time. Now we must just
provision in line with our growth.

On some other measures, our performance is improving but requires
further improvement. I refer to measures such as Return On Equity,
Return on Assets and Earnings Per Share. These performance ratios
were, of course, affected by our abnormal item, but will improve as
we leverage existing investments and employ our capital to best
effect.

The abnormal item also suppressed earnings per share. Despite this,
we increased the dividend as the underlying growth in earnings per
share was strong. We are confident it will further increase this
year.

We continue to see improvement in our cost ratios, with the headline
cost-to-income figure driving below 70 cents last year. Although the
nature of our business means we will never achieve the lowest ratio
in industry comparisons, further improvement is likely in coming
years - (although perhaps not this year given the transition costs
associated with First Australian).

You will have noticed Mr Hunt and I pointed out in our Annual Report
that comparing our performance ratios with those of the major banks
ignores underlying factors which are detrimental to regional banks -
the requirement for higher capital ratios, the disproportionate cost
of (APRA) supervision, and higher funding costs. This is not to
excuse poor performance, because we acknowledge the need to
continuously improve, but these issues do impact on performance,
profitability and shareholder value. We are focused on these issues
and we will continue to raise them in appropriate forums.

Before leaving our performance review, I am pleased to report two
positive pointers:

* Firstly, our business continues to track strongly, with growth and
  profitability for the first quarter of operations slightly 
  exceeding our budget targets, and

* Secondly, international credit rating agency Standard 
&
 Poor
'
s has
  placed Bendigo Bank on a 
"
positive
"
 credit watch, indicating the
  possibility of improvement in our credit rating. Such an upgrade
  would assist our cost of funds and is eagerly awaited.

We have so far demonstrated our relevance and the strength of our
underlying performance: what of our prospects? These are buoyant on
many fronts.

Our core business continues to grow rapidly. Many of our established
branches have reached the point where they are substantial sized
businesses in their own right. There is no sign of this rapid growth
waning and we look forward to continued growth in contributions from
our core retail arm here in Victoria. Contrary to a press article a
couple of months ago which asserted that Bendigo was losing market
share to the major banks in residential lending, we continue to grow
our share of the total market - and this after securitising \$189
million in loans.

I have spoken of our interstate expansion. Queensland will obviously
be a key focus. That business is in a very similar position to that
in which we found ourselves prior to bank conversion and, we believe,
has similar growth prospects to those we have enjoyed in recent
years.

First Australian has a good branch network, a sound customer
franchise, enthusiastic staff and a service culture - an excellent
foundation for growth. Bendigo will bring to the partnership a large
kitbag of new products, leading-edge banking technology, a reputation
which is unmatched by any other bank, and a determination to
contribute to those communities in which First Australian operates.
We have been welcomed to Queensland by its State Government and
Opposition, by local councils and by business groups and we look
forward to working closely with them. In short, our potential for
business growth there is huge.

Acquiring First Australian delivers other benefits, too. The extra
capacities and skills brought to the Group enabled us to reassess our
operations to ensure we service our growing markets most efficiently.
We have decided to build in First Australian
'
s Ipswich head office a
state-of-the-art loan processing centre which will use the latest
technology to service lending for the entire Group.

Not only does this secure a good business outcome, but it
demonstrates Bendigo
'
s strong commitment to the Ipswich community.
Successful communities create a successful bank. We put our money -
or is it yours? - where our mouth is.

Community Bank will continue its rapid expansion. At last years
'

meeting I indicated we expected to have up to 25 branches open by
now; in fact we have 29, with a further 11 confirmed to follow.

Community Bank has proven to be successful for communities: it has
provided them with the certainty of branch banking services, it has
boosted their capacity to further develop their districts and it is
providing them with attractive financial returns. As I said earlier,
successful communities create success for us and Community Bank is
certainly doing that. The program has greatly lifted our exposure
around Australia and helped create business opportunities. It also
made a solid contribution to our 1999/2000 profit and this will grow
rapidly as established branches grow and more branches open. Having
seen Community Bank establish its bona fides and its profitability,
we have now determined to accelerate its rollout over this financial
year and beyond.

Having achieved the prediction I made last year - exceeded it,
actually - I might as well stick my neck out again to forecast that
by next year
'
s AGM we will have 50 or more Community Bank branches
around Australia.

Our prospects have never been better.

* We have growing market share.

* We are broadening our reach.

* Investments in technology and training are paying dividends and can
  be further leveraged as we grow.

* Through the Bank and our subsidiary, companies, we now provide a
  comprehensive range of banking and related financial services.

* And crucially, we enjoy public trust and a position of eminence in
  the rating of banks by many Australians.

Much of my address today has concerned change, but it is underscored
by one constant - and that is our unwavering focus on our Customers
and their communities. Their success is our success and we must never
forget that. Bendigo Bank and this, our home city, have enjoyed a
mutually beneficial relationship for 142 years and we have built a
strong company on the back of the loyalty thus generated. It is in
our interests to translate this formula to all these new markets we
are now entering.

Finally, as we expand our horizons, we are expanding our Shareholder
base, too. We are therefore endeavoring to provide all Shareholders
with the opportunity to be informed and to participate in the
Company.

Next Monday, we will hold a shareholder information session in
Melbourne at which I will deliver this address before inviting
questions from the floor.

With this year
'
s Annual Report, we mailed out a question form
encouraging Shareholders to send us their questions prior to today
'
s
meeting. There was an encouraging response - containing a mixture of
bouquets and brickbats - and I propose to deal with the most popular
questions today and to mail to all Shareholders a summary of today
'
s
meeting and answers to the questions we received.

Two major areas of interest to Shareholders were the abnormal item -
with which I have already dealt - and the business item relating to
Directors
'
 fees, which is next item on today
'
s agenda. At that time,
I will explain our reasons for seeking an increase in the global
budget available for Directors
'
 remuneration and will then invite
speakers from the floor prior to putting the motion to the meeting.

A substantial number of shareholders raised questions about our share
price and our capital management plans. Some ask why our price has
not risen in line with the major banks. Our share price, of course,
is determined by the market, which considers many factors -
performance and prospects key among them. It is worth noting that the
dividend yield on our shares compares with the yield on major bank
shares. Some investors might therefore consider our shares are
reasonably priced.

Nevertheless, we remain focused on adding value for our shareholders
and capital management assumes great importance in doing so. We have
a separate business unit dedicated to more effectively employing
capital in order to increase ratios such as Earnings Per Share and
Return on Equity. We are employing various strategies including off
balance sheet growth and joint venture alliances which do not require
significant application of capital.

Our tier one, or share capital position is currently very healthy and
capital raising in the short term will be in the form of tier two
capital - subordinated debt. As we do, however, require enough
capital to support our rapid growth, the Board has determined that
the Dividend Reinvestment and Bonus Share plans will continue in
their current formats for the time being.

Speaking of shares ... another common question was whether or not
Bendigo Bank planned to offer an online share-trading facility. The
short answer is, yes. Our system is currently under development and
we plan to launch it early in the New Year. You will certainly hear
more through your Shareholder newsletters.

A number of shareholders entreated us to open new branches in their
district (and on that note, I am pleased to acknowledge in our
audience today the Hon Jock Granter from Heathcote, who has pressed
this particular inquiry on his town
'
s behalf at last year
'
s AGM).
Opening branches is an expensive exercise and any new venture must
demonstrate it can meet the Bank
'
s targeted rate of return. So
although we continue to expand our network, we do so at a rate which
balances our support for new communities with our responsibilities to
you, our Shareholders. Rest assured, though, you will continue to see
new Bendigo Bank shingles appearing across Australia.

As I mentioned, many Shareholders sent bouquets of praise for our
efforts both on their behalf and on the part of those many, mainly
regional, communities we are now supporting through our various
initiatives. The support of Shareholders is valued, but is not taken
for granted - we understand we are working on your behalf.

Those were the main issues raised by shareholders. These and other
questions will be further answered in the summary of this meeting
which you will shortly receive by post.

It would be remiss of me to let today pass without mention of last
month
'
s retirement from the Group of Brian Thomas - or 
"
EB
"
 as we
have affectionately known him during his 22-year association with the
Bendigo. Brian has been general manager, managing director and
director of the Bank and spent the past two years as chairman of
Sandhurst Trustees. He was ever a loyal, capable and hard-working
contributor to our success and is rightly credited as being the
visionary who set us on our expansionary path. Some of you might have
recently seen the excellent article in the Bendigo Advertiser which
noted that Brian began his working life in a trustee company - the
Farmers and Citizens - before ending it in a trustee company 57 years
later. I take this opportunity, on your behalf, to wish Brian and
Judy a long and happy retirement growing their pine trees at Mt
Macedon. (It certainly beats farming rabbits at Harcourt!)

Before closing my address, I wish to formally thank my fellow
Directors for their continued support and for their unstinting work
on your behalf. I also wish to thank staff throughout the Group, more
than 90 per cent of whom, like you, have a direct stake in our
Company. Our staff are our standard-bearers and provide the service
which we believes stands our Bank apart. Finally, I thank on your
behalf our management team and their inspiring leader, Rob Hunt, whom
I now invite to address the meeting

UNSECURED NOTES TRUST DEED DATED 28 APRIL 1998

REPORT UNDER CLAUSE 11.1(d) - QUARTER ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1999

We report, in accordance with the Unsecured Notes Trust Deed dated 28
April 1998 (the Deed) between Bonlac Foods Limited (the Company) and
Perpetual Trustees Victoria Limited (the Trustee), that there are no
matters materially adversely affecting the Notes or the interest of
the Noteholders, including:

   (i) the Company has complied with, and not exceeded the 
       limitation set out in clause 3 of the Deed in that:

       * the principal payable on outstanding Notes does not exceed 
         the Maximum Amount (\$500,000,000); and

       * the Company has not borrowed more than the Maximum Amount
         (\$500,000,000) under the Deed

  (ii) the Company has complied with each of the other convenants 
       given under the Deed;

 (iii) the total number of the Notes outstanding as at 31 December
       1999 was 1,000,000;

  (iv) the total number of other Perpetual Notes on issue as at 31
       December 1999 was Nil;

   (v) as at 31 December 1999:

       * distributable profit was \$170,154,000

       * consolidated shareholders
'
 funds were \$322,246,000

       * subordinated debt was \$71,256,000

  (vi) interest was due and paid on 31 December at the rate of 9.5% 
       pa; no principal has been repaid during the quarter nor was 
       due at the end of the quarter;

 (vii) the Board has not resolved to repay any principal;

(viii) no event has happened which has caused, or could cause
       (whether with the passage of time or otherwise), the Notes or 
       any other term of the Deed to become enforceable;

  (ix) there has been no substantial change in the nature of the
       business conducted by the company or any of the entities it 
       controls during the quarter;

   (x) no event referred to in clause 18 of the Deed has occurred or
       will, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, 
       occur. Specifically:

       * there has been no failure to repay principal

       * there has been no order or resolution for the winding up of 
         the Company, nor has an administrator been appointed nor 
         deed or arrangement entered into 

       * there has been no judgement executed or enforced against the
         Company exceeding \$10,000,000

       * no controller (as defined by the Corporations Law) has been
         appointed

       * there has not been any suspension of debts, and the Company 
         is able to pay debts as and when they fall due
     
       * the Company has not entered into any arrangement or 
         composition with Creditors under section 411 of the 
         Corporations Law; 

  (xi) the Company has not deposited money with, lent money to, or
       assumed liability of any related body corporate during the 
       quarter. The Company has lent money on an unsecured basis to 
       United Milk Tasmania Limited (UMT) to enable that entity to 
       redeem certain redeemable preference shares as part of the 
       merger arrangements between Bonlac Foods and UMT, as reported 
       previously. The amount outstanding in this regard at 31 
       December 1999 was \$23,205,752. In addition, the Company has 
       provided UMT with fully drawn unsecured working capital 
       facilities in the normal course of business and in 
       substitution for part of earlier secured facilities provided 
       by banks to UMT. The amount outstanding at 31 December 1999 
       was \$27,084,028. None of the foregoing is expected to 
       materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company to 
       meet its obligations to Noteholders; 

 (xii) the Company has adequately insured the assets of the Company
       and the entities it controls against fire and other risks 
       normally insured.

On 18 January 2000 Bonlac Foods issued a joint statement with
Australian Co-Operative Foods (
"
Dairy Farmers) announcing the
establishment of a joint committee to consider the possibility and
feasibility of a merger. Discussions are at an exploratory stage
only. On 18 January the Chairman of Bonlac Foods also announced the
resignation of Mr Phillip Scanlan AM as Managing Director and Chief
Executive Officer and the appointment of Alex Sloan as Acting Chief
Operating Officer.

BANK OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA LIMITED
Perth
CORPORATEFILE.COM
BankWest Limited recently reported a steady underlying profit of
\$111.3 million in the 6 months ending August 31, 2000. What change
occurred in net interest margins through the period and what impact
did that have on profit?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
Net interest margins were steady over the first half of this year
when compared to the first half of last year. We therefore benefited
from the growth in volume. Our net interest income line was up 7 per
cent or \$12.6 million over the corresponding half.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
What is the outlook for net interest margins?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
It depends on several things but the key is rate movements and, in
particular, the relative movement of the cash rate versus the bill
rate with most of our lending products being tied to the cash rate.
If this relationship remains stable, we don
'
t expect any significant
deterioration in net interest margins. We expect the net interest
margin to be more stable than it has been.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Total loans and acceptances grew 8.4 per cent in the latest 6 months
versus the February period. Did speculation about the ownership of
BankWest and the sale of Bank of Scotland
'
s equity in BankWest impact
on lending growth?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
Yes, we believe it did. The main impact was on business lending,
particularly in the east coast markets. We have addressed that and
the lending growth over the last 3 months has been significantly
stronger than the growth in the previous 3 months.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Just how did it impact on business lending?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
By unsettling customers, potential customers and staff. It has
settled down. It
'
s not an issue going forward.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Growth in lending in Western Australia was up 5.6 per cent and
interstate lending grew 13.8 per cent during the half. What future
lending growth do you expect from Western Australia and interstate
business?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
Very similar in Western Australia but probably a bit stronger over
the next 6 months in the interstate markets.


It is interesting. We
'
ve just received the State-by-State economic
growth figures which show that the West Australian economy has grown
at a significantly lower rate than the national economy over the last
2 years.

Growth in final demand outside Western Australia has been about 5.5
per cent pa while in Western Australia it has averaged only 1 per
cent pa - so 5.6 per cent lending growth in the West Australian
market was a good result.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Are rising rates an issue for future growth rates in lending?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
They are but given the major part of our growth is coming in
interstate markets where we have such a low market share, it
'
s not
such a problem for us because we are still growing into a bigger
market.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Alliances are a core component of your interstate growth strategy.
How will you convert alliances with RACV (1.4 million members) and
Ansett Global Rewards (1.7 million members) into profitable growth?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
On the housing side, the main part of our growth is still coming
through mortgage originators, finance brokers and planners. That
business has been exceptionally strong. Our approvals were well up at
over \$1.8 billion compared with about \$1.4 billion in the previous 6
months. Our interstate broking and financial planning alliances have
largely driven that growth.


Brands like RACV and Ansett Global Rewards are evolving growth
opportunities. We see significant upside but they
'
re still relatively
small compared to the mortgage origination channel. Alliances are a
new area that we
'
ve been working on for a number of years and they
'
re
not a high cost channel for us. There is more to be gained from using
other brands to sell our banking and financial services.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
The charge for doubtful debts was lower at \$5.6 million compared with
\$6.1 million in February and \$9.3 million in August last year. Why
was the charge lower and what is the outlook for credit quality?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
The charge was lower mainly because of lower specific provisions and
stronger recoveries compared with the same period last year. During
the 6 months to August last year, commodity prices deteriorated and
this impacted on some of our mining sector leasing assets. That is
behind us. Commodity prices have since picked up.


Leaving aside that particular issue, our credit position has remained
sound for a number of years now. We believe we
'
re at the bottom of
the cycle when we might expect some deterioration in credit quality
but we
'
re not actually seeing it at the moment.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Although net interest income improved 6.5 per cent to \$196.8 million
versus the February half, other operating income dropped 2 per cent
to \$95.4 million and was down 1 per cent against the corresponding
half last year. What caused the fall?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
There were three factors. Firstly, last year we accounted for
TrustWest through the bank. TrustWest was put into Precedent which
became Plan B Financial Services. There was about \$6 million of
income in TrustWest last year which wasn
'
t included this year.


Secondly, our treasury operations had a very strong first half last
year at \$10.3 million. Treasury income for the first half this year
came back to a more normal level of \$8 million.

Thirdly, our application fees from business lending interstate were
about \$1 million short of the corresponding half last year,
reflecting a slower start to business lending this year.

When you take those factors out, there was actually growth in
non-interest income.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
What future income stream do you expect from software licence and
consulting income?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
It
'
s hard to predict because the income stream is lumpy. At the
moment, consulting income covers the costs of operation. Growth in
earnings comes through software licence sales.

It is difficult to predict the number and quantity of software
licence sales but we have a very good product. As we gain credibility
in the market, more organisational banks will take it on. We believe
the growth curve will be exponential rather than flat.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Total operating expenses increased 5.9 per cent to \$180.9 million
versus February and 6.9 per cent versus August last year. Salaries
were a factor, rising 7.5 per cent to \$65.9 million versus February
and 3.6 per cent versus August. What impact did investment in new
businesses have on the cost trend?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
Quite a substantial impact because we added 30-40 staff in CBS
Integrated Solutions. We also grew our e-commerce area quite
substantially. They were the two major areas adding to staff numbers.
We also increased staff in our lending centre to cope with the extra
volume of home loans and for the introduction of the Jet Away Home
Loan.


Essentially, most of the increase was growth related, or
strategically related, around e-commerce. Additional factors included
a higher level of marketing spending associated with the introduction
of our new brand in Western Australia - the 
'
We hear you and Harry
hears you
'
 brand. And some additional money was directed to
sponsorships to support local community activities.

The GST
'
s introduction also added \$1.4m to operating expenses.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
What will be the full impact of the GST
'
s introduction and how much
of the GST related expense can be recovered?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
We believe our total GST expense will be in the order of \$9 million
and we
'
ve put in place plans to recover about \$5 million of that
expense.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
What contribution did your 50 per cent shareholding in Plan B
Financial Services make in the latest period?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
A very small negative contribution reflecting the consolidation of
Plan B into BankWest. There was some goodwill write-off from the
consolidation.


corporatefile.com
What growth targets have you set for Plan B?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
Very high. We want to double the business very quickly and translate
that into a stronger bottom line. The financial planning business
takes some time to develop but its a good business with a good
market position and an excellent customer offering.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Why is bankwest reaching into it services - beyond traditional
banking and financial services?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
This is mainly a reflection of two significant market opportunities
and a recognition of our strengths.

In the case of CBS Integrated Solutions, we had developed some very
good software that we thought could be commercialised and it is
proving its commercial value.

In the case of IT services, a specific opportunity arose from our
position here in Western Australia. We had our IT area, more
particularly our Data Centre, benchmarked by an international company
and it came up very strongly.

There was an opportunity in this market for an additional out-sourcer
and Unisys, the worldwide company, came to us and said they would
like to partner us in setting up an out-source and e-commerce venture
in Western Australia.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
What future contribution do you anticipate from this BankWest and
Unisys Australia Joint Venture, Unisys West?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
It depends on contracts gained. It
'
s not about to get bigger than the
banking business but we think it will make a good contribution to the
bottom line.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Do you have an exit strategy for investments outside of traditional
banking and financial services?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
Yes, particularly in the case of Unisys West. If it doesn
'
t work out,
we will bring it back in-house. We are mindful of exit strategies for
all of the investments we make.

CORPORATEFILE.COM
Finally, what is the BankWest profit outlook?


CEO TERRY BUDGE
We are expecting a stronger second half than the first half. We
expect to achieve growth in profits for the year over and above last
year
'
s figure which included abnormals from the first half.


CORPORATEFILE.COM
Thank you Terry. We look forward to the next Open Briefing with
BankWest.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

1. MARINE DRIVE

During the quarter the Company entered into an agreement for a
potentially revolutionary marine drive technology, which is subject
to certain conditions precedent. A due diligence review to evaluate
the technology, including the construction of a 4.1 metre aluminium
runabout powered by a prototype of the marine drive system, has
progressed.

Construction of the boat was substantially completed during the
quarter and debugging of the system components was undertaken.
Preliminary evaluations are encouraging and testing is scheduled for
completion by mid February 2000.

2. OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGIES

Carnegie
'
s wholly owned subsidiary New Millennium Engineering Pty Ltd
has progressed with its stated role of acting as an incubator for new
technologies. An in-house Independent Review Group with commercial,
technical and marketing expertise has been established with
formalised procedures whereby prospective new projects are evaluated.
The Company is currently assessing a number of interesting projects
that may fit its development criteria.

3. MINERAL SANDS, THE GAMBIA - WEST AFRICA (100% INTEREST)

Following the completion of independent analysis of the acquired
historic geological data and using in-house remote sensing materials,
the Company continued its study of the potential to further increase
the mineral sands resource base both within the Company
'
s Exclusive
Prospecting License and the neighbouring areas.

This study also included a review of the possible commercial
opportunities to dispose of the zircon tailings stockpile located
within the Company
'
s license area which remains from mining
operations carried out in the 1950
'
s. The Company is currently
organising a five tonne sample of zircon pre-concentrate to be
extracted and shipped to a prospective industry buyer who wishes to
assess the product
'
s suitability for its processing and marketing.

4. DIAMONDS, PILBARA - WESTERN AUSTRALIA. (100% INTEREST IN TWO
GRANTED EXPLORATION LICENSES AND ONE LICENSE APPLICATION)

Late in the December quarter, two 70-block exploration licenses were
granted to the Company along the Coongan river system downstream of
the Stockdale/Haoma Joint Venture. The Stockdale/Haoma JV discovered
the 30 kilometre long diamondiferous Brockman Dyke, which has been
proven to contain macro-diamonds. That dyke is considered to be part
of an extensively eroded kimberlite system that suggests possible
placer diamond deposits within the region. The Company
'
s licenses
have been positioned to cover possible alluvial deposits downstream
of the extensive diamondiferous intrusions discovered.

A third Carnegie application for an exploration license within the
Coongan-De Grey river system is still pending.

5. DIAMONDS, COTE D
'
IVOIRE - WEST AFRICA (25% INTEREST IN AFRICAN
CARNEGIE DIAMONDS PLC 
"
ACD
"
)

During the quarter, Absolut Resources Corp, who have an option to
acquire ACD
'
s interest in the primary targets within the Bobi Joint
Venture area in Cote d
'
Ivoire (the alluvials remain with ACD)
announced the following:

Absolut Resources Corp is pleased to report the results of caustic
dissolution of surface outcrop samples taken from a kimberlite dyke
from Cote d
'
Ivoire. Absolut has committed to spend (Cdn)\$3,500,000 on
exploration on or before June 30, 2004 and pay (Cdn) \$1,000,000 in
cash or ALR shares to earn the interest. Absolut has committed to
spend (Cdn) \$150,000 on or before June 30, 2000.

The Seguela area has been the site of previous mechanized alluvial
mining by an American group and current non-mechanized alluvial
mining by local artisans since the 1930
'
s. Production figures
reported to the government for this period are in excess of 800,000
carats, however, known clandestine mining activities have been
estimated to have produced an additional 500,000 to 1,000,000 carats.
The diamond deposits are underlain by Precambrian rocks of the West
African Craton that underlies much of the northwest part of Africa
extending from the coastal Cote d
'
Ivoire north to Mauritania.
Although kimberlite dykes have been mapped, only alluvial/coluvial
deposits have been mined.

The sampled dyke, referred to as the Toubaboukou dyke, strikes
northwest, is one to three metres wide and is known to be three
kilometres long from geophysical mapping. The results reported below
are from a 900 metre section of the southwest part of the dyke. Due
to overburden and poor outcrops, the remaining part of the dyke was
not sampled at this time. Based on the preliminary results, the 900
metre portion of the dyke which was sampled, can be divided into a
high grade section from approximately 300 metres.

TOTAL                                     56 

Sample #6 (7 kilos) contained seven diamonds with total weight of
0.008 carats. This caratage equated to 1.14 carats per tonne of
kimberlite whereas sample #7 (7 kilos) had 24 diamonds that weighed
0.006 carats equating to 0.86 carats per tonne of kimberlite. Of the
56 diamonds recovered, 54 were micros and 2 were macros. Although
none of these stones were of curable size, the weight per tonne has
very significant exploration potential. Over 95% of all diamonds
recovered were white transparent stones.

INDICATOR MINERAL CHEMISTRY

Chromite, garnet and ilmenite have been recovered as residues from
the caustic dissolution. Preliminary micro-probe results of chromite
grains show chromium/titanium and chromium/magnesium plots indicative
of mantle peridotite sources favourable for the formation of
diamonds. Throughout the world, chromite inclusions in diamonds with
CR-Ti and CR/Mg ratios as found in these Seguela kimberlites indicate
potentially economic deposits.

The company is very encouraged with the diamond counts, the estimated
diamond weights per tonne and the mineral chemistry of the indicator
mineral chromite. Further mineral chemistry studies are underway and
expected to confirm the favourability of the mantle source rocks. The
next phase of exploration will include trenching and sampling of the
northwestern part of the dyke followed by diamond drilling later this
year.

6. GOLD, MITCHELL TENEMENTS - HIGGINSVILLE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA. (A
ROYALTY OF A\$16 PER OUNCE ON ALL GOLD PRODUCTION)

Resolute Limited advised that no production occurred during the
quarter.

7. DIAMONDS, IVANHOE PROJECT - KUNUNURRA, WESTERN AUSTRALIA. (20%
DILUTING)

Project operator, AuDAX Resources NL, advised that following
subsidence of several backfilled drill holes over the last wet season
a ground survey of all holes was undertaken during the quarter to
ascertain which holes required further backfilling. As a result of
this survey a local earthmoving contractor was engaged to complete
backfilling of several holes to meet Department of Minerals and
Energy environmental rehabilitation requirements.

8. CORPORATE

* The Company
'
s change of status and name were finalised, permitting
diversification into non-resource areas. Carnegie intends to maintain
and continue its natural resource activities.

* A placement of 10,000,000 shares with one free attaching option for
every two new shares subscribed was finalised to raise \$280,000.

HIGHLIGHTS

MARINE DRIVE TECHNOLOGY Significant progress was made in better
adapting the trial boat to deliver the inputs to the Marine Drive
section of the vessel. A tank test of the latest configuration was
completed with good results. Improvements to the heat transfer
section are currently well advanced and an oceanic trial of the
vessel is expected imminently.

OTHER TECHNOLOGIES Ongoing due diligence was undertaken on several
potential new projects and the Company expects this process to
crystallize one of the projects during the next quarter.

MINERAL SANDS, The Gambia, West Africa - The analysis of a zircon
pre-concentrate from a stockpile located at the Company
'
s licence
area was completed in the Carpco laboratories in Jacksonville, USA,
on behalf of a potential buyer. The results are positive and validate
the suitability of the material as supplementary feed for existing
processing operations.

DIAMONDS, Pilbara, Western Australia - The Company entered into an
agreement with Ashton Exploration Australia Limited (
"
Ashton
"
)
whereby Ashton can, subject to ministerial approval, earn an interest
in the Company
'
s exploration licences EL 45/2116 and EL 45/2117.

"
The bid precedes by months the start of a toll treatment arrangement
between Heron and Centaur which would see Heron produce between 400
and 500 tonnes of metal this year using Centaur
'
s Cawse treatment
plant. With the cash flow production, it is likely Centaur would have
to pay a lot more for the nickel explorer.
"


Heron will not be able to treat any ore through Cawse Stage I until
the fourth quarter of 2000 at the earliest and this can only occur if
a valid nomination is received by Centaur.

Assuming a valid nomination is received for the fourth quarter of
2000 and if Centaur processed the maximum of 10,000 tonnes of Heron
ore during this quarter through Cawse Stage I, this would result in
the production of approximately 150 tonnes of nickel equivalent
metal.

Furthermore, cashflow to Heron from the processing of its ore through
Cawse Stage I in the fourth quarter of 2000 would not commence until
Centaur receives proceeds for the sale of the metal produced from the
Heron ore. Under marketing arrangements this would mean proceeds from
the sale of metal production in the fourth quarter of 2000 would not
commence until at least December 2000.

Accordingly, the statement in the newspaper is false.

In our view, it is incumbent upon Heron to correct this false report
by immediate clarification to Australian Stock Exchange Limited and
for Heron to take all reasonable steps to ensure that such false
statements are not repeated by the said newspapers.

Please advise whether or not your client will today comply with this
request. If it does not, then Centaur itself will tomorrow clarify
the false statement by, inter alia, publishing the contents of this
letter to Australian Stock Exchange Limited and the media generally.

DATAFAST TELECOMMUNICATIONS LIMITED
Melbourne
The Directors wish to advise that the company has commenced
negotiations for an interconnection agreement with Telstra
'
s PSTN
network.

The agreement, once signed, is expected to increase Datafast
'
s
revenue by around \$24 million per annum.

Directors advise that the outcome of this agreement will provide
Datafast
'
s clients in regional areas with lower cost communications
including telephony, data, internet and vision.

G Wilkinson
DIRECTOR


MEDIA RELEASE

DATAFAST, TELSTRA IN \$24 MILLION INTERCONNECT ARRANGEMENT

New generation carrier, Datafast Telecommunications Limited, has
started negotiations with Telstra to enter into an interconnection
agreement between the Telstra PSTN network and Datafast
'
s new Voice
over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network.

Datafast
'
s director of network services, Mr Gary Wilkinson, said
today 
"
This agreement will help realise an additional \$24 million in
annual revenue for our company.


"
The Interconnection deal when reached will be a win win outcome for
both Telstra and Datafast.


"
Once the arrangement is in place it will provide a mechanism for
Datafast to bill Telstra for calls being made through our network.


"
The contract will dramatically expand and enhance Datafast
'
s voice
network by allowing access to/from our system into the Telstra
network.


"
Telstra has a huge market of its own, so when calls from this market
are routed through the Datafast infrastructure, we will receive
additional revenue thereby expanding earnings already generated by
our existing customer base.
"
"
Furthermore, the Interconnection will create the discounted rates
through which Datafast can deploy calls into the Telstra network
giving customers cheaper call rates.
"


Datafast signed a strategic alliance agreement in November 1999 with
the US giant Lucent Technologies group.

Part of that arrangement was the introduction, design and deployment
of a multi-services network that will deliver Internet, voice, data
and vision over an Internet protocol. 

In addition, Lucent continues to introduce Datafast to new US
technology companies and models to implement in Australia.

Issued by:                        Datafast Telecommunications Ltd 
                                  385 Bourke Street

DURBAN ROODEPOORT DEEP
Perth
NOTICE TO SHAREHOLDERS REGARDING AN INVESTIGATION BY THE BOARD

1. On 18 January 2000 the board of Durban Roodepoort Deep, Limited
(
"
DRD
"
) announced the appointment of a committee consisting of two of
its non-executive directors, Messrs Nick Goodwin and Grant Fischer,
and its human resources director, Mr Vic Hoops, to undertake an
investigation in relation to the allegations of certain share trades
and related issues and with power to co-opt independent experts to
assist in such investigation. The committee was assisted in its
investigation by Deloitte 
&
 Touche (Forensic Services) and Feinsteins
Attorneys.

2. Following its investigation, the committee reported to the board.
The main findings of the committee are as follows:-

2.1 in reaction to strong rumours in the market of a potential
hostile bid for Randfontein Estates Limited (
"
Randfontein
"
) at the
beginning of December 1999, Roger Kebble (
"
Kebble
"
), the chairman of
DRD, appointed Mr John Stratton (
"
Stratton
"
) as a consultant to
devise a defensive strategy against any take-over bid for
Randfontein. Such a bid would have had severe repercussions for DRD
and its then joint management arrangement with Randfontein;

2.2 in terms of the strategy adopted by Stratton, which strategy was
approved by Kebble, he purchased on behalf of DRD through nominee
accounts, a strategic parcel of shares and options, including, inter
alia, Randfontein;

2.3 the purchase of the shares by Stratton was undertaken without the
knowledge and authority of the DRD board;

2.4 Kebble had an overall knowledge of these transactions but not the
day to day specific detail thereof;

2.5 there was no trade in Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited
(
"
Harmony
"
) shares by DRD which took place with its knowledge or
approval;

2.6 during the period from 14 December 1999 to 11 January 2000, funds
totalling approximately R113.7 million were received by DRD from
Western Areas Limited (
"
Western Areas
"
). There was no authorisation
from the board of DRD in respect of these funds;

2.7 corporate governance procedures which would be expected to have
been applied by DRD were not adhered to in relation to the above
transactions;

2.8 Deloitte 
&
 Touche may be required to further examine and report
on any of the issues raised in its report.

3. Having considered the committee
'
s findings and the relevant
facts:-

3.1 the board decided that the purchase of the shares in Randfontein
and other gold-related shares was and is both strategically and
financially in the interests of DRD. The board has accordingly
ratified the purchase of the shares;

3.2 the board found that there were no arrangements, agreements or
negotiations between the board of DRD and the Western Areas board
regarding the receipt of funds or the purchase of the shares on DRD
'
s
behalf;

3.3 an agreement in principle, was concluded between Western Areas
and DRD during February 2000 for the repayment of these funds. The
board authorised the financial director to conclude these
negotiations and to enter into an agreement in terms thereof;

3.4 the board has reprimanded the chairman for his conduct and has
accepted his explanation and apologies in regard to the circumstances
surrounding the purchase of the shares. The board further accepted
that the chairman had acted in the best interests of DRD and its
shareholders in the circumstances prevailing at the time;

3.5 no evidence has been forthcoming of any benefit or personal gain
by any individual.

4. The board has appointed Deloitte 
&
 Touche to review its corporate
governance policies and practices to ensure future compliance with
the standards set out in the King report

Source:   EPIC Report for 6 months ended 31 December 1999 
          EPIC Annual Reports

The results are clearly unsatisfactory and changes need to be made.
The following resolutions are important. We believe shareholders
should vote in in favour of all the resolutions. However in the
process of improving results it is probable a number of additional
changes will be required.

Resolution 1: That Equity 
&
 Property Corporation Ltd ACN 006 601 289
will comply with the requirements of the Australian Corporations Law.

Comment: Without any discussion about the past we would presume this
is a matter all shareholders will agree on and vote in favour of.

Resolution 2: That Equity 
&
 Property Investment Corporation Ltd ACN
006 601 289 will comply with the Australian Stock Limited listing
rules.

Comment: In the EPIC 1999 Annual Report it states the number of
shareholders is 232 shareholders. In the EPIC Prospectus dated August
22 1997 under Risk Factors are the following statements.


"
EPIC does not currently have shareholder spread required by the
Listing Rules
"


AND 
"
If EPIC does not meet the shareholder spread requirements of the
ASX, its Official Quotation on the ASX could be placed in jeopardy
"


As at 30 June 1997 EPIC had 256 shareholders. 
As at 30 June 1999 EPIC had 247 shareholders.

What is the EPIC Board of Directors doing about this matter?

Resolution 3: That the company report to shareholders on the cost,
operating expenses and revenues from the Blue Chip Bar at the Swiss
Grand Hotel Bondi Beach Sydney NSW 2000.

Comment: In the 1998 EPIC Annual Report in the Director
'
s Review
section there is the following statement.


"
In line with the Group
'
s strategy of progressive property upgrade,
\$3 million was invested to refurbish the Hotel dining facilities,
create smaller conference rooms and build an up-market bar/gaming
centre.
"


Surely the Directors of EPIC would like shareholders to know how the
bar/gaming centre is operating. Would they consider shareholder
incentives or discounts to visit the bar and utilise the gaining
facilities?

Resolution 4: That Mr Ong Leong Huat be and is hereby removed as a
Director of EPIC

Comment: Mr Ong is according to the 1999 EPIC.Annual Report the
largest shareholder in EPIC and under information on Directors in the
same Report is the following.


"
Ong Leong Huat @ Wong Joo Hwa, Non-Executive Director Mr Ong is the
Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of OSK Holdings Berhad, a
company listed on the Main Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE). He was appointed a Director of OSK Holdings Berhad on 21
November, 1990 and has been the Chief Executive of OSK Securities
Berhad since July 1985. Prior to that he was attached to a leading
financial institution for a total of 17 years from 1969 to 1985, and
has held the position of Senior General Manager. He holds a Dealer
'
s
Representative Licence and is a Corporate Nominee of OSK Holdings Bhd
on the Board of OSK Securities Berhad. He sits on the board of
several other private limited companies.
"


His brother Mr Wong Chong Shee is also on the board and another
brother Mr Wong Ah Chiew resigned as a Director of EPIC on 31 July
2000 but was appointed an alternate Director for Mr Tan Eng Lam as
from 1st August this year. Mr Tan is apparently related by marriage
to Mr Ong.

Mr Ong lives in Malaysia.

What contribution has Mr Ong made to the EPIC results?

We argue that the company requires a number of appropriately
qualified resident Australian Directors who understand the Australian
business conditions and the regulatory regime, Mr Ong, as the largest
shareholder, should be keen to see an improvement in the company
'
s
fortunes.

Resolution 5: That Mr Tan Eng Lam be and is hereby removed as a
Director of EPIC.

Comment: Under information on Directors in the EPIC 1999 Annual
Report the following is provided on Mr Tan.


"
Tan Eng Lam, Non-Executive Director Mr Tan is the Executive Director
of PJ Development Holdings Berhad. He is a Civil Engineer, being a
graduate from the University of Malaya in 1974. He obtained his
degree of Master of Business Administration from Golden Gate
University, San Francisco in 1988. He has over 18 years experience in
property development of residential and commercial projects.
"


He apparently resigned from PJ Development Berhad in or around
January 2000.

In the 1997 EPIC Annual Report under section 30 Directors
'
 Interest
in Shares and Options he held 1,750,000 EPIC shares.

In the 1998 EPIC Annual Report under Directors
'
 Interest in Shares
and Options he held 94,298 EPIC shares.

In the 1999 Annual Report Mr Tan apparently has no interest in shares
in EPIC in this name.

Has Mr Tan reported the transfer of his EPIC shares?

We understand Mr Tan lives in Malaysia. What contribution has he made
to the EPIC results?

Resolution 6: Mr K J Russell be and is hereby appointed to the Board
of Directors of Equity 
&
 Property Investment Corporation subject to
providing a consent to act.

Comment: Mr Russell is a chartered Accountant with considerable
experience and expertise particularly having regard to Australian
business conditions.

Resolution 7: That Mr J Tilburn, being over 72 years of age, be
hereby appointed as a Director of the Company to hold office until
the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting.

Comment: Mr Tilburn is a well known shareholder in many Australian
companies. He brings to the company a single minded and forthright
spirit to improve EPIC
'
s results.

EQUINOX RESOURCES NL
Perth
REPORT ON ACTIVITIES 

In late December the Company made the important decision to proceed
to Phase 2 of the Lumwana Joint Venture in Zambia between Phelps
Dodge and Equinox. The Company completed a Due Diligence Study on the
Lumwana Copper Project, with the assistance of independent specialist
resource and engineering consultants, which resulted in a positive
recommendation to proceed. Equinox now has the right to earn 50% of a
major copper resource by spending US\$5.0 million over 4 years.
Equinox then has the potential through various elective options to
increase this equity to 75%. The Lumwana Due Diligence Study has
verified the resources, defined them in accordance with the
Australasian JORC Code, commenced the preliminary evaluation of
development options for the project, and most importantly identified
a number of highly prospective exploration targets.

Elsewhere in Zambia, the Anglo American funded Zambezi Joint Venture
1999 field program was concluded and planning for the 2000 program
commenced. Activities were ongoing on some of the Company
'
s main
Australian projects in the Gawler and Curnamona Cratons. In Sweden,
joint venture discussions continued regarding the funding of
Equinox
'
s activities in Norrbotten and additional tenements were
granted in the prospective Skellefte Belt. 

AFRICA: COPPER-COBALT-GOLD EXPLORATION

ZAMBIA: LUMWANA JOINT VENTURE - Phelps Dodge 
(Equinox earning up to 755%) 

PROJECT LOCATION AND HISTORY 

The Lumwana Copper Project is located in northwestern Zambia,
approximately 220kms west of the Copperbelt. The project is covered
by a 1,350sqkm Retention License and is crossed by the highway
linking the Copperbelt to northwest Zambia. Two major copper
deposits. Malundwe and Chimiwungo, and a number of other significant
copper occurrences have been defined within the project. Since the
initial discovery by Roan Selection Trust (RST) in the 1960
'
s a
number of pre-feasibility studies have been completed of which the
most recent was the 1995 Bateman study commissioned by Phelps Dodge.
This study was based on a mineable reserve of 201.8 Mt at 0.83% Cu
and an ore production rate of 10.5 Mt/year over 20 years. At the time
of the study the project did not meet the Phelps Dodge financial
investment criteria. However, since 1995 significant changes to
various project parameters, including the privatisation of the
Zambian Copperbelt and the ongoing development of alternative mining
and processing technologies have resulted in improvements to the
economics of the project.

EQUINOX ELECTS TO PROCEED TO PHASE 2 OF JOINT VENTURE WITH PHELPS
DODGE 

During the December Quarter, Equinox completed a Due Diligence Study
on the Lumwana Project and as a consequence of this critical review,
on the 24 December 1999, Equinox elected to proceed to Phase 2 of the
Lumwana Joint Venture with Phelps Dodge. Equinox is committed to
spend US\$1.0 million (of which US\$180,000 has already been spent) and
the Company has the right to earn 50% of the Project by expending a
total of US\$5.0 million within 4 years. Equinox then has various
rights by which it may increase its interest in Lumwana to 75%.

DUE DILIGENCE STUDY 

Equinox conducted the Due Diligence Study with the assistance of
independent consultants with specialist skills. The Resource Service
Group (RSG) critically reviewed project development alternatives,
cost estimates and financial analysis. 

* RESOURCE DETERMINATION

The RSG study validated the Phelps Dodge database and defined the
Lumwana copper resource at a variety of copper cut-off grades in
accordance to the Australasian JORC code. The resource estimation by
RSG uses Multiple Indicator Kriging and is based on consistent 2m
composites and selective mining unit (
"
SMU
"
) dimensions of 10mE x
20mN x 5mRL SMU blocks. RSG considered the estimations to be globally
realistic, confined by a reasonable geological interpretation and
supported by robust variography. The resource determination by RSG
for the two deposits is as follows.

ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS INTERNATIONAL LI
Perth
Shareholders have received a detailed report on the year in the
Annual Report. I would like to repeat a number of the highlights.

* Revenue increased by approximately 10% to \$16.3 million and
operating profit rose to approximately \$0.7 million.

* The world
'
s first ENERSLUDGE(TM) plant, after a great deal of
effort by our staff, our joint venture partner Clough Engineering and
indeed by the client, Water Corporation of Western Australia, is now
working as an integrated plant is in the final stages of
commissioning. As we speak, the plant is treating most of the sludge
from one-third of Perth
'
s population (approximately 300,000) and is
producing oil and the other expected by-products. I will comment
further on the ENERSLUDGE(TM) technology in a few moments.

* ESI
'
s water and wastewater business continued to provide cash flow
for the company. This year our successful water and wastewater
business won its first contracts in Victoria. ESI is now a
well-established company servicing the water and wastewater industry
nationally and we expect to win new contracts in the near future.
Significant in this has been the strong working relationship, which
your company has developed with the Water Corporation of Western 
Australia.

* Two of the company
'
s wastewater projects are worth highlighting:

(i) ESI designed and built the wastewater treatment plant for the
Olympic Games site. Over 2 million litres per day of treated effluent
from ESI
'
s plant was further processed and used for irrigation and
other purposes on the site. I was lucky enough to go to the Olympics
and I was delighted to see around the main stadium signs saying the
stadium was using recycled water.

(ii) The largest wastewater treatment project in Australia today is
the upgrade to the Water Corporation
'
s Woodman
'
s Point plant, south
of Perth. ESI
'
s biological nutrient removal (or BNR) technology was
selected for this new plant to cater for over 600,000 people. This is
by far the biggest application of the company
'
s BNR technology.
Already there have been a number of exciting technological
breakthroughs which can be transferred to future ESI facilities, the
project is on schedule; at this stage it appears as if there will be
capital savings flowing from the innovative breakthroughs.

* I mentioned last year, we faced a number of technical challenges in
getting the first commercial scale ENERSLUDGE(TM) plant in the world,
to the stage where we are satisfied, the 
"
technology
"
 works and is

"
commercially competitive
"
. I am happy to report we believe we have
overcome all major technical obstacles and have established the
commercial viability of the process. Importantly the operating costs
of the technology are essentially as originally forecast to the Water
Corporation. As mentioned at last year
'
s AGM and in my Chairman
'
s
Report, the ESI/Clough Joint Venture has incurred cost overruns on
this project due to variances in the sludge feed and other technical
matters, but we are confident a good portion of these costs will be
recouped. 

* Outside of Australia, we have two smaller demonstration
ENERSLUDGE(TM) plants working satisfactorily, namely the Mitsubishi
Electric Corporation plant in Japan and our own plant in Germany.

* Mitsubishi should build its first commercial scale plant in 2001 and
has identified a large market (approximately 1,500 plants) for
smaller and medium size plants in Japan. ESI will receive royalties
for each plant Mitsubishi builds.

* The commissioning of the plant in Germany progressed very
smoothly. The tests on sludges for 5 tanneries across Germany are
underway. Our expectation is that these tests will lead to the
construction of a full-scale ENERSLUDGE(TM) plant by 2002.

* Market research in the UK and the Americas has identified a large
number of immediate opportunities for new and retrofit ENERSLUDGE(TM)
plants. The co-inventor of the process, Trevor Bridle is not here
today as he is in the UK speaking with 3 water companies that have
sought concept designs and costings for ENERSLUDGE(TM) plants about
the same size as we have built in Subiaco.

* On his return to Australia he will be advancing discussions on two
further opportunities in Singapore, a sewage sludge conversion plant
at Jurong, and a plant to treat 
"
oily
"
 sludges from Singapore
'
s oil
refineries.

* Your Board
'
s preference is to market to ENERSLUDGE(TM) technology on
a 
"
Build Own Operate
"
 or 
"
Leasing of Conversion Equipment
"
 basis as
this should provide both higher returns to shareholders and a more
constant cash flow for your company.

ESI Managing Director, Denis Glennon, will provide further details on
these marketing developments and the prospects for ESI
'
s technology
over say the next 5 years, in a short presentation at the end of the
meeting.

Your Board believes the Company is better placed than ever to take
advantage of the opportunities which are available to companies with
the right suite of products to meet a number of the pollution
prevention demands of today
'
s world.

Our dedicated staff have again displayed an outstanding level of
commitment. We have maintained our key professional staff. All have
demonstrated a continued eagerness to accept new challenges that
stretch expertise and set higher standards in an industry that is
closely monitored by society. In particular I would like to
congratulate Trevor Bridle and his team on the success of the Subiaco
ENERSLUDGE(TM) plant. This has been the culmination of many years of
hard work and commitment by Trevor and his team.

I would also like to thank all our employees and especially our
Managing Director Denis Glennon for their hard work and dedication
during the last year. At the same time, I would like to take this
opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support and
patience.

Finally, I would like to say I believe your company stands on the
cusp of great things. In this clean green world we live in we have
technologies which will be in great demand. Our ENERSLUDGE(TM) 
process not only solves a major pollution problem but in the process 
provides a renewable energy source which should lead to tradeable
carbon credits

EXODUS MINERALS LIMITED
Perth
OVERVIEW

The Company has moved to reposition itself this quarter in what it
believes is an improving climate for exploration companies.

Significant funds have been raised through a placement of shares to
clients of Johnson Taylor and from the cash consideration as part of
the Laverton Joint Venture with Delta Gold Ltd (
"
Delta
"
). These two
raisings will see the cash on hand increase to approximately \$1.9
million with 33.1 million shares on issue.

At the settlement of the joint venture with Delta, the Company will
have four major regional exploration projects, only one of which
requires immediate significant expenditure by the Company. In summary
the projects are:

Laverton, Western Australia - a major joint venture with Delta, and
two other joint ventures with Anglogold Australia and Metex-Delta.
The Company is hopeful that the Delta Joint Venture will lead to near
term gold production from the Mikado deposit. 

Reynolds Range, Northern Territory - a 2,500 sqkm joint venture with
Normandy-North Flinders where Exodus can earn 60%. A \$250,000 -
\$350,000 budget has been allocated to this new gold mineralised
province where grades up to 75g/t gold and 30 metres at 2.5g/t gold
have already been achieved in drilling.

Broken Hill, New South Wales - WMC are exploring a 450sqkm area
southeast of Broken Hill, Exodus has a 20% loan carried interest.

Peak Hill, Western Australia - this 100% owned, 1,500 sqkm area has
been acquired at low cost through strategic pegging. An exploration
strategy is being developed for this area while the tenement
applications are processed.

Exodus is active in four major mineralised provinces at a relatively
low cost and low risk and is now seeking opportunity for further
projects or investments.

LAVERTON AREA, WESTERN AUSTRALIA

Exodus has reached agreement with Delta Gold Limited to form a joint
venture over a number of the Company
'
s tenements in the Laverton
region.

Under the terms of the joint venture agreement;

* Exodus will transfer a 60% interest in the tenements to Delta in
return for an immediate cash payment of \$300,000, a further \$50,000
after one year and a free carry of Exodus
'
s remaining 40% interest.

* Delta can define one or more Development Areas for which it may
complete feasibility studies to a bankable standard. Upon decision to
mine Delta may elect to: 

- pay 75% of the NPV of Exodus
'
s 40% interest in the project plus \$10
  per ounce royalty on all ounces in excess of feasibility study
  estimates, to move to a 100% interest, or free carry Exodus to
  commencement of mining.

* Delta have also agreed to complete a BFS at the 145,000 ounce
Mikado deposit within 30 months or return the project to Exodus.

* The tenements the subject of this agreement are detailed in
attached Schedule A.

Exodus is now well placed having a continued risk free exposure to a
major exploration effort in the Laverton area by successful explorers
who have access to a processing facility.

A major discovery would see Exodus gain a significant up front
payment with no further outlay, no risk exposure to the mining
process and with upside preserved through the royalty. 

METEX JOINT VENTURE, LAVERTON 
(Exodus 25%, Metex Resources NL 37.5% and manager, Delta Gold NL
37.5%)

No significant activity during the quarter.

REYNOLDS RANGE, NORTHERN TERRITORY 
(Exodus earning 60% from Normandy Gold Pty Ltd) 

Exodus has assumed management of the expanded Reynolds Range project
and rationalised the tenement portfolio. Unprospective tenure has
been relinquished and applications for additional tenure have been
made.

Preparation of a comprehensive work programme for the integrated and
extended project is well underway with a major programme of vacuum or
RAB drilling planned for May - June 2000.

ROWENA JOINT VENTURE 
(Exodus 100%, Anglogold Australia earning 75% and manager)

No activity this quarter.

PEAK HILL, WESTERN AUSTRALIA 
(Exodus 100%)

Work continues on data compilation and developing an exploration
strategy for this major landholding.

BROKEN HILL, NEW SOUTH WALES 
(Exodus 20% WMC Resources 80%)

Exodus has retreated to a 20% loan carried interest in this project.
This in effect means that the Company will not be required to
contribute to any further exploration expenditure on the tenement
until the completion of a Bankable Feasibility Study. The loan
accumulated by Exodus is repayable only from the proceeds of sale of
50% of Exodus
'
s product from the joint venture. WMC will not have any
recourse to any assets of Exodus other than the proceeds from 50% of
Exodus product.

WMC have advised they intend to spend up to \$450,000 in the coming
year on geophysical and geochemical exploration.

CORPORATE/FINANCIAL

On 3 March 2000 shareholders approved the Company entering into a
Deed of Termination with Saracen Management Pty Ltd whereby the
Company was released from its obligations under the Management
Agreement with effect from 1 April 2000 and received certain
furniture and equipment to enable it to recommence its independent
operation, in return for payment by the Company of \$100,000 to
Saracen Management Pty Ltd.

Exodus reached agreement with Johnson Taylor (Perth) on 21 February
2000 to place 5.9 million shares and 1.5 million options to clients
of Johnson Taylor raising \$1,077,604 net of fees.

The placement was made in two tranches: - 

- An immediate placement of 3,910,000 shares at 15.2 cents per share
(of total of \$594,320) being 15% of the issued capital at 80% of the
weighted market price for the five business days before 21st February
2000.

A second tranche of 3 million shares with 1.5 million attaching
options (exercisable at 20 cents) at 18 cents (a total of \$540,000)
being the last sale price on 21st February 2000. This tranche was
issued following the approval of shareholders at a General Meeting
held on 10 April 2000.

Johnson Taylor will be paid a fee of 5% of the proceeds.

On completion of the placement Exodus will have 33,114,450 shares on
issue.

FIVE ARROWS AUSTRALIA FUND LIMITED

MEDIA RELEASE

For Immediate Release: 12 April 2000

LEGISLATIVE CHANGES DISADVANTAGE INVESTORS

ASX-LISTED THE FIVE ARROWS AUSTRALIA FUND LIMITED LOOKS TO WIND UP

The Board of the ASX listed investment company The Five Arrows
Australia Fund Limited (FAAFL) believes the legislated changes to the
Capital Gains Tax (CGT) regime, is recommended by the Ralph Report,
has had a detrimental impact on the tax effectiveness of FAAFL.

Based on tax advice, the Board has formed the view that an investment
in FAAFL is not an attractive method for investors, to access the
Australian sharemarket.

Consequently, the Board of FAAFL has resolved to convene a General
Meeting of shareholders to vote on a special resolution to place
FAAFL into members
'
 voluntary liquidation.


"
The Board believes that given the adverse circumstances currently
facing the Company, shareholders should be offered an opportunity to
decide the Company
'
s future,
"
 said the Chairman of FAAFL, Mr Peter
Griffin.

Like many other listed investment companies, FAAFL
'
s share price is
trading at a significant discount to its net tangible asset backing.


"
Under the present environment the Board believes that this discount
is unlikely to narrow in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the
Board believes that many shareholders might prefer to liquidate the
Company and realise the Company
'
s net tangible asset backing,
"
 Mr
Griffin said.

He added that 
"
Each shareholder will need to consider the resolution
to wind-up in the light of the shareholder
'
s personal financial
circumstances and tax position. The directors recommend that
shareholders take advantage of the opportunity to vote on this
important matter.
"


Shareholders will vote on the special resolution at a General Meeting
to be held on 16 May 2000.

FOUNDATION HEALTHCARE LIMITED
Perth
MEDIA RELEASE

REVIEW OF COMPANY ACHIEVEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

In February of this year the company changed its activities to become
a provider of Facilities and Services to General Practitioners
(GP
'
s). Since that date Foundation HealthCare has successfully
expanded its operations from being focussed on the Western Australian
market to now being a national company operating in 5 states and
territories of Australia. To date Foundation has contracted to
provide services to 745 GP
'
s operating from 85 practices generating
patient revenues of \$93m, which together with revenues from other
sources of \$34m results in the company having total revenues under
management of \$127m. This represents approximately 4% of GP
'
s
practicing in Australia.

We have adopted a singular focus on the provision of services to GP
'
s
that has been well accepted, as evidenced by the large number of
Australian GP
'
s who have committed to our Company. Foundation
continues to receive enquiries from across Australia from GP
'
s
interested in joining our organization. These enquiries together with
our own development activities will enable the Company to continue to
grow at a significant rate.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

Due to the growth activities of the Company as well as later than
anticipated settlements on contracted acquisitions, an operating loss
before tax of \$354,000 was incurred for the 6 months ended 30 June
2000.

As at 30 June the company had entered into contracts to supply
facilities and services to GP
'
s who generated \$11m of patient
billings, \$3m of which was settled only in the last week of June
2000. This compares to the projection in the prospectus for that
period of contracting by 30 June 2000, doctors who in total generated
\$22m of patient billings. As such our revenue from Management Fees of
\$1.1m for the 6 months ended 30 June was down over 40% on that
forecast in the Prospectus. Revenue from our pathology operation was
in line with our prospectus projections.

It should be noted that the loss for the 6 months related purely to
the WA operations, as the below mentioned Eastern States acquisitions
all settled or will settle post 30 June 2000. It should also be noted
that the loss for the 6 months ended 31 December of \$5.8m relates to
activities of Foundation prior to the takeover of the company by the
previous management and as such management is unable to comment on
the reasons for the loss.

SIGNIFICANT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

ACQUISITIONS

Subsequent to 30 June the company has entered into numerous
additional contracts and heads of agreement for the acquisition of
further rights to provide services to general practitioners well in
excess of the prospectus projections. These acquisitions have
previously been announced to the market and relate to businesses in
NSW, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and the ACT.

The acquisitions since 30 June relate to the rights to provide
services to GP
'
s who generate annual patient revenues of \$82m.
Together with acquisitions completed before 30 June, total fees under
management as at the date of lodgement of this report total \$93m pa.
Based on this level of revenue, Foundation will charge a management
fee in the vicinity of \$44m pa for the provision of services and
facilities to those GP
'
s. This represents an amount two and half
times the prospectus projection for the year ended 30 June 2001.

In addition, the acquisitions of Peak Health and Immediate Health
Care in NSW and United Healthcare in Victoria will generate for
Foundation revenues of \$16m pa in relation to subtenancy rentals for
pathology, radiology, dental and other health professionals. This is
in addition to the \$18m of revenue that Clinipath Pathology will
generate on an annual basis. As such at the date of this report
Foundations annualised revenues in relation to other than the
provision of services to GP
'
s totals \$34m.

MANAGEMENT

The negotiations of these acquisitions both before and after 30 June
has taken significant management time, particularly in relation to
our Western Australian operations. This had a negative impact upon
the profitability of these operations during the period. This issue
has now been resolved with the appointment of Mr Lou Bacher and Mr
John Flint, respectively as General Manager and Financial Controller.
The primary responsibility of these two executives is to maximise the
performance of our WA operations.

Importantly the Eastern States acquisitions include management teams
experienced in the health sector who have the skills and capacity to
apply Foundations business model on a state by state basis across
Australia.

CENTRE DEVELOPMENTS

In WA the development of a number of our medical centres has already
commenced. Construction of 2 fully comprehensive health care centres
is underway, and are both due for completion during late 2000 or
early 2001. In addition major refurbishments of 2 medical centres
will be completed in the next 2 months.

It is through the construction and operation of these centres that
Foundation will realise the true potential of our acquisitions.
Numerous other building and property development projects are in the
planning phase and the company is currently investigating
opportunities to restructure the funding requirements of these
developments.

CREATION OF ALLIANCES 

As also previously disclosed to the market Foundation has created
alliances with both Sonic Healthcare Limited and LifeCare Health
Limited. These alliances will enable Foundation to maintain its focus
on general practice (this singular focus having been fundamental to
our success to date), whilst aligning our Company with the premier
national providers of diagnostic and allied health services.

As alliance partners we will also be in a position to assist each
other in the development of numerous areas of each of the company
'
s
businesses. These will include IT, Management systems, Medical Centre
developments and research projects.

CAPITAL RAISINGS

Since 30 June the Company has completed a capital raising of \$50.71m.
The new shares issued were placed with leading Australian
institutional fund managers and Sonic Healthcare, The investment by
Sonic represents part of our Alliance Agreement with that company.

These funds together with previous raisings and bank facilities
provide the funding required for the above mentioned acquisitions.

CONCLUSION

In summary, Foundation now manages annualised existing practice
revenues on behalf of GP
'
s and other revenues of \$127m pa, which will
deliver to the Company management fees and rental revenues of 
\$78m pa.

The acquisitions of established, profitable businesses across
Australia has secured for Foundation the management and
implementation skills required to continue the company
'
s growth,
whilst at the same time managing those businesses to achieve optimum
results for all stakeholders.

FIRST AUSTRALIAN BUILDING SOCIETY LIMITE
Brisbane
CHAIRMAN
'
S LETTER TO FP HOLDINGS SHAREHOLDERS

SHARE EXCHANGE WITH BENDIGO BANK LIMITED

On 5 June 2000 First Australian Building Society Limited (
'
First
Australian
'
) and Bendigo Bank Limited (
'
Bendigo
'
) announced their
intention to merge. 

If that merger proceeds, there will be an immediate effect on FP
Holdings (Building Society) Limited (
'
FP Holdings
'
). Currently FP
Holdings has a buy-back arrangement in its constitution whereby FP
Holdings Shareholders can exchange 10 FP Holdings Shares for 9 First
Australian Shares. 

The buy-back arrangement was established in 1996 at the time of the
amalgamation of certain of the assets of First Provincial Building
Society Limited (
'
First Provincial
'
) and Ipswich and West Moreton
Building Society Limited. Shareholders in First Provincial were given
the option of either taking up shares in First Australian at that
time, or retaining their shares in First Provincial (later to change
its name to FP Holdings) and exchanging them for First Australian
Shares at a later time. The purpose of this arrangement was to give
FP Holdings Shareholders flexibility in relation to when they
crystallised a disposal of their shares for capital gains tax
purposes.

If the merger between First Australian and Bendigo proceeds, FP
Holdings will no longer hold First Australian Shares. Instead it will
hold New Bendigo Shares. It will therefore be unable to utilise the
buy-back arrangements set out in its constitution. FP Holdings will
need to instigate some change to address this situation.

Having considered a range of options, the Board of FP Holdings have
developed a share exchange proposal whereby FP Holdings Shareholders
will exchange their shares in FP Holdings for New Bendigo Shares.
They will cease to have rights as members of FP Holdings and will
instead become shareholders of Bendigo. Each FP Holdings Scheme
Shareholder will receive 9 New Bendigo Shares for every 20 FP
Holdings Scheme Shares held.

This share exchange proposal is to take place by way of a Scheme of
Arrangement, details of which are set out in this FP Holdings Scheme
Booklet, and the Common Booklet. If the Merger between First
Australian and Bendigo does not proceed, then the share exchange
proposal set out in this booklet will also not proceed.

The majority of the directors of FP Holdings believe that the share
exchange proposal is in the best interests of FP Holdings
Shareholders, and represents a great opportunity for FP Holdings
Shareholders. The views of all directors are set out in full in
section 1.10. This has been supported by the opinion of the
Independent Expert, set out in this FP Holdings Scheme Booklet and
the Common Booklet.

I urge you to read this FP Holdings Scheme Booklet, and the Common
Booklet, carefully before making your decision on how to vote in
relation to this important proposal.

FXF TRUST
Sydney
CPH Management Limited (the 
"
Manager
"
), the responsible entity of CPH
Investment Corp (formerly FXF Trust) (
"
Trust
"
), today announced
changes to the terms of the proposed issue of Partly Paid Units
(
"
Issue
"
), under the Prospectus dated 10 April 2000, associated with
the expansion of the investment strategy and capital of the Trust.
The key changes are as follows:

* An adjustment to the pricing mechanism for the Issue so the Issue
Price will be set based on the net tangible assets (
"
NTA
"
) per Unit
of the Trust, based on the 3 day volume weighted average price of
shares in John Fairfax Holdings Limited (
"
Fairfax
"
) immediately prior
to the close of the Issue, up to a maximum of \$1.00 per Unit rather
than a fixed price of \$1.00 per Unit. The first instalment of the
Issue Price, payable on application for the Partly Paid Units, has
been reduced from \$0.60 to \$0.50 per Partly Paid Unit. 

* The Issue size being set at up to 400 million Partly Paid Units
(with a right to accept oversubscriptions of up to a further 100
million Partly Paid Units). The CPH Group will continue to invest in
the Issue to maintain its 31% unitholding in the Trust. 

* An adjournment of the unitholder meeting until 22 May and an
extension of the Issue period until 25 May in order for a
Supplementary Prospectus to be prepared and lodged with ASIC and
Supplementary Explanatory Statement to be prepared and sent to
unitholders.

Details of the changes to the terms of the Issue will be set out in
the Supplementary Prospectus to be lodged with ASIC.

The decision to expand the Trust
'
s investment strategy beyond that of
a single purpose investment trust by pursuing opportunities outside
of its Fairfax shareholding has been, in the opinion of the Manager,
further supported by the recent adjustments to asset values in global
equity markets. The Manager believes that lower asset prices should
provide greater opportunities to the Trust and hence potentially
provide greater returns to unitholders in the future.

The decision to adjust the pricing mechanism allows maximum
flexibility in potentially volatile market conditions. Under the new
pricing mechanism, where Units in the Trust trade above the NTA per
Unit (as they have since the announcement of the Proposal on 27 March
2000), investors will be able to acquire Units at a discount to the
market price. In no event will investors be required to pay more than
\$1.00 per Unit. Based on the closing trading price of Fairfax shares
on 19 April of \$5.33 per share, the Issue Price would be \$0.80 per
Unit.

Investors who have already applied for Partly Paid Units in the Issue
will be refunded any application monies. All investors wishing to
acquire Partly Paid Units will need to complete the new application
forms which will accompany the Supplementary Prospectus.

The offer of Partly Paid Units is made in the Prospectus dated 10
April 2000
as amended by the Supplementary Prospectus

GUANGDONG BUILDING INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Melbourne
BUSINESS REVIEW AND PROSPECTS

OVERVIEW

Following the announcement of an orderly winding down of the
operations of the Group
'
s principal subsidiary, Full Arts Metal Works
Limited, and its subsidiaries on 27 March 2000, the Board of
Directors has adhered to this strategy and operated the Group
'
s
business only to the extent necessary to discharge the Group
'
s
existing commitments. As a result, the Group
'
s turnover and the scale
of operations have drastically reduced for the six months ended 30
June 2000 (
"
the Period
"
). During the Period, the Group continued to
face very difficult operating conditions in the Hong Kong
construction sector. In addition, the Group continued to suffer from
the adverse effects of an interim standstill arrangement (the

"
Interim Standstill Arrangement
"
), which the Company announced on 4
March 1999. The adverse effects on the Group of the Interim
Standstill Arrangement have been to freeze the availability of bank
credit facilities to the Group and caused the Group difficulties in
seeking optimum returns from existing projects on hand as well as the
recovery of the Group
'
s receivables.

During the Period, the Group has strictly controlled its costs and
overheads. There have been further cuts in staffing levels for the
Period. In view of the difficulties faced by the Group, it has
adopted a conservative approach in preparing its financial statements
for the Period. Further provisions, including provisions for doubtful
trade debts and provisions for foreseeable losses in projects, have
been made.

GROUP
'
S RESULTS

The unaudited consolidated turnover and net loss attributable to
shareholders for the Period were HK\$42.8 million (A\$9.1 million)
(1999: HK\$94.7 million (A\$18.5 million)) and HK\$56.3 million (A\$12
million) (1999: HK\$148.5 million (A\$28.9 million)) respectively. The
net loss attributable to shareholders for the Period was reported
after including provision in respect of doubtful debts of HK\$20.6
million (A\$4.4 million) (1999: HK\$23.6 million (A\$4.6 million)) and
provision in respect of foreseeable losses for contract work in
progress of HK\$13.2 million (A\$2.8 million) (1999: HK\$97.7 million
(A\$19 million)). 

BUSINESS REVIEW

During the Period, the Group continued its efforts to complete the
existing projects and these projects have progressed as planned. The
projects on hand such as the E-Wah A Kung Ngam and Tai Po 118 will be
completed at the end of this year. Phase I of Belcher Garden is
expected to be completed in November 2000 and Phase II is expected to
be completed in year 2001.

RESTRUCTURING

The progress of the restructuring of the financial liabilities of the
group of companies of which Guangdong Investment Limited (
"
GDI
"
) is
the holding company (
"
the Restructuring
"
) has been disclosed in the
chairman
'
s statement of the annual report of the Company for the
financial year ended 31 December 1999. The Board of Directors expects
that definitive documentation relating to the Restructuring will be
entered into shortly as described in a circular dated 15 September
2000 issued by GDI to its shareholders.

PROSPECTS OF THE GROUP

The Group will continue to wind down its business in an orderly and
efficient manner with a view to fulfilling its existing contractual
obligations. The Board of Directors is currently exploring a range of
options with regard to the Company
'
s future.

INTERIM DIVIDEND

The Board of Directors has resolved not to declare the payment of any
interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2000 (1999: Nil).

RALEIGH PROSPECT, KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA 
(GOLDFIELDS KALGOORLIE LIMITED ABN 12 009 712 092, A SUBSIDIARY OF
GOLDFIELDS LIMITED) 30 JUNE, 2000

An Indicated Mineral Resource of 224,000 tonnes at 20.0g/t gold and
an Inferred Mineral Resource of approximately 76,000 tonnes at
13.1g/t gold is estimated for the Raleigh prospect. Raleigh is
located on a granted Mining Lease M16/157 about 22 km northwest of
Kalgoorlie, and 2.5km southeast of Goldfields Kalgoorlie
'
s Kundana
Mine. The resource is categorised as follows:

The prospect is located in volcano-sedimentary rocks which form part
of the Eastern Goldfields Province of the Archaean aged Yilgarn Block
in Western Australia. The primary mineralisation is hosted by a
structurally controlled, laminated quartz vein that dips steeply
towards the west-southwest. The vein has been modelled to 300m
vertical depth and over a length of 350m. The true thickness varies
from 0.01m to 0.61m, with an average of 3lcm.

At 40m x 20m and 40m x 80m drill intercept spacing, geological
continuity is demonstrated. The grade estimation used inverse
distance squared interpolation of the metal accumulation (grade x
thickness), using conservative top cuts and other parameters
appropriate to the data density. Sample locations, drill sample
recoveries, and analytical performance were to acceptable standards.

The resource was based on two separate block models. An 
"
open pit
"

model was generated using both reverse circulation and diamond
drilling data. The reserve was derived from a pit optimisation using
Whittle 4X software and a gold price of A\$464/ounce.

An underground model for fresh rock below the optimised pit was
generated using only diamond drilling data. Mining parameters in line
with current site practice and observation were applied to the
resource to estimate the underground reserve.

Aspects of this report that relate to Mineral Resources and Ore
Reserves are based on information compiled by Jon Lea who: 

* is a Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy,
  and 

* is full-time employee of the Company, and

* has sufficient relevant experience of the activity undertaken and
  of the mineralisation style and type of deposit described

Jon Lea qualifies as a Competent Person as defined in the 1999
Edition of the 
"
Australasian Code for the Reporting of Resources and
Reserves
"
, and has consented to the inclusion in this report of his
information in the form and context in which it appears.

GRAINCORP LIMITED
Sydney
ATTACHMENT 1 MATERIAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF
THE ECONOMIC ENTITY

STORAGE AND HANDLING REVENUE

During the financial period to date, GrainCorp Limited (GrainCorp)
has received 7.9 million tonnes of grain (1998/99 receivals: 6.1
million tonnes). This resulted in sales revenue for storage and
handling of $96.5 million for the half year ended 31 March 2000, as
compared with $71.7 million for the half year ended 31 March 1999.
The increase in revenue is largely the result of an increased
harvest, higher levels of stock held throughout the period and timing
of exports.

MARKETING REVENUE

GrainCorp received Marketing revenue of $154.8 million for the half
year ended 31 March 2000, as compared with $66.9 million for the half
year ended 31 March 1999. This significant growth in marketing
activities has contributed to the increase in receival tonnes into
the storage network, through the provision of marketing and servicing
options to growers and customers. The marketing results shown in the
segment accounts do not reflect all the financial benefit and
contribution to profit from marketing as a proportion of the result
is reflected in the storage and handling results from additional
tonnes.

PROFIT

The economic entity recorded a profit before tax of $37.3 million and
after tax of $27.4 million for the half year ended 31 March 2000 as
compared with $22.9million and $15.9 million respectively for the
half year ended 31 March 1999. This variation is largely the result
of increased tonnages and was partly offset by increased harvest
costs and higher depreciation and interest costs.

OTHER 

In addition a change in pricing policy for the 1999/2000 Season
has occurred, whereby fees for outloading services are no longer
invoiced and paid in advance but invoiced and paid at the time of
outloading. This has had an adverse impact on net operating cash
flows during the current period.

A change in accounting policy occurred in September 1999 for the use
of equity accounting in associates. The effect of this change on the
half-year profits to 31 March 2000 has been an increase of $2.1
million after tax and there is no corresponding figure for the 6
months to 31
March

Summarised above is a snap shot of the financial results of the group
for the past 6 months. The operating result was in line with
expectations and delivered within an operating environment that was
significantly constrained by the major capital works currently being
undertaken at our Market St building. It is expected these works will
be substantially completed by financial year end and in good time for
the Olympics.

The bottom line for the half benefited significantly from the profit
realised on the partial sell down of our first venture capital
investment. Open Telecommunications contributed more than \$2 million
to the results for the period.

PROPERTY DIVISION 

At last, the end is in sight. Before the end of this half we should 
be seeing the tail end of the builders and be well on the way to 
celebrating the complete reinvigoration of our landmark Market and 
George St building. The floors that are currently finished are 
spectacular and proving very popular with prospective and existing 
tenants. 

I look forward to reporting to you at financial year end a completed,
near fully leased building.

Our retail development at Norton St was finished prior to Christmas.
We are at an advanced stage of negotiation with one of the big four
banks to lease our space.

INVESTMENT DIVISION 

The Investment group has had a very good 6 month period. Besides our 
ongoing management of the listed investment portfolio, we have made 
three investments in non listed companies since our last letter to 
shareholders. The run away success has been Open Telecommunications 
Ltd where we made a pro IPO Investment. The stock upon listing went 
from \$1 to \$4.50 and is currently trading over \$11. We have taken 
substantial profits on this stock which is highlighted in our 
abnormal profit figure. Further, we made another investment 
in an IT company called Pospro Group Pty Ltd. This company is 
a leading retail software company specialising in internet orientated
as well as traditional retail software applications. We have taken a
substantial stake in this company. This was a strategic investment
for the company, as Pospro group is our Point of Sale provider.
Pospro is currently reviewing the possibility of raising additional
capital through a stock market float. To this end it has engaged
Investment Bank HSBC as an advisor. Should the company float, it is
likely Gowing
'
s stake will substantially increase in value.

Our underlying portfolio has seen limited change in strategy and
remains focussed on identifying undervalued quality stocks. The
unexpected polarisation of the equity markets in the past 6 months
has resulted in many high quality stocks reporting strong profit and
dividend increases but seemingly out of favour with Investors. Not
only do we continue to take a long term view to these stocks but we
have increased our investment in some accordingly.

The size of the underlying stock portfolio and cash position has
reduced over the last 6 months. However taking into account the
dividend paid post year end, the off market share buyback initiated
in October 1999 and the payment of more than \$5 million towards the
renovation of the Market Street and Norton St sites out of cash
reserves, the investment portfolio at its current value has performed
extremely well.

RETAIL DIVISION 

The retail staff have worked extremely hard in the last year to cope 
with not only the usual hectic retail schedule all retailers face but 
also with the constant demands placed on them and our customers as a 
result of the redevelopment at Market Street. I must thank them all 
for their efforts as they are the public face of Gowings and have 
maintained enthusiasm through very trying times. As expected retail 
sales over the last 6 months have dropped in comparison with the 
corresponding period in the previous year. However the fall has been 
less than anticipated and I must sincerely congratulate the staff and 
thank our customers for their loyalty.

With the completion of the Market Street redevelopment, Gowings has
continued to investigate new retail distribution opportunities. I am
pleased to report we are poised to enter into two leases for stores
at the Sydney International Airport. We are very excited about
servicing travelling Australians and departing international tourists
at this very high profile location. The stores are expected to begin
trading in June and in plenty of time for the Olympics.

As mentioned in the Property summary, the works at Market Street are
expected to be completed by financial year end and then we will
relaunch our Market Street store to the public and showcase a
selection of retailers operating with us over 6 interconnected
floors. We are very excited about the new store and we believe it
will continue to remain the icon the old store has been in Sydney to
date. The new design should alleviate any previous customer confusion
about other retail floors, lower the opportunity for store shrinkage
and generate additional traffic.

In the interim before the works are completed we expect trading
conditions to be difficult.

GOWINGS AND ECOMMERCE 

The second version of the Gowing
'
s world store on the internet is up 
and running and has been a success for our business since its launch 
pre Christmas. The online store and business is expected to continue 
to grow in profile as well as sales over time and we have been very 
happy with the response received to date. Generating traffic on line 
has been a steep learning curve but I am confident we will be one of 
the long term retail players on line. We have entered into strategic 
alliances with both Yahoo and Ozemail with regard to the shopping 
sections of their sites and have been encouraged by the results 
achieved to date. Further we are endeavouring to continue to grow 
third party alliances to ensure we generate high levels of qualified 
traffic to our site. 

GOWINGS IS GST READY 

GST is a new issue facing us in the coming year. A GST task force has 
been established headed by a senior executive. The company is working 
closely with the Australian Retail Traders Association and is 
confident that GST will be seamlessly introduced on July 1.

INTERIM DIVIDEND 

The directors have declared an interim ordinary fully franked 
dividend of 3 cents. The dividend (last year 3 cents) will be paid at 
the normal time, ie the last business day in April. The Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan and Bonus Share Plan remain in operation.

My fellow directors and I wish to thank all shareholders for their
support over the previous 6 months and we look forward to the growth
opportunities that the company currently has before it.

GYMPIE GOLD LIMITED
Sydney
CORPORATE OVERVIEW

Gympie Gold Limited has two wholly-owned operating subsidiaries:

* Gympie Eldorado Gold Mines Pty Limited (
"
Gympie Eldorado
"
) produces
gold from high grade deposits at Gympie in south east Queensland, and

* Southland Coal Pty Limited (
"
Southland Coal
"
) produces high quality
coking coal from the renowned Greta Seam in the Hunter Valley, New
South Wales.

Gympie Gold Limited
'
s strategy is to maintain good shareholder
returns while pursuing opportunities for exceptional returns,
including:

* Expansion of Gympie Eldorado via decline access and mechanised
mining equipment coupled with continuing exploration for large gold
deposits in the Gympie district.

* Expansion of Southland Coal to become the leading producer of
metallurgical coal in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales based on
Southland
'
s renowned high fluidity, low ash Greta Seam coal which is
the highest quality coking coal of its type.

The Company is continuing negotiations with various parties about
alliances for the accelerated expansion of both businesses, which it
proposes to separate by December 2001.

FINANCE

At the end of the quarter, the company
'
s cash and gold bullion was
\$2.5 million and the group had unused credit facilities in place.
Borrowings stood at \$9.6 million other than \$1.7 million spent by
Roche Mining on the Lewis Mine development and limited recourse coal
stockpile finance of \$A1.4 million.

GOLD AND CURRENCY HEDGING

The company
'
s gold hedging strategy is to sell forward at prices
above A\$500 per ounce to cover costs and leave its upside potential
unhedged.

At the reporting date, 208,000 ounces had been sold forward with
Rothschild Australia to deliver by June 2006 at prices no less than
\$520 per ounce. An additional 80,100 ounces have been sold forward
with the National Bank to deliver by June 2004 at \$539 per ounce via
Roche Mining our gold mining contractor for the new Lewis Mine.

For coal, currency hedging facilities have been established for
\$US49.8 million of coal sales during the next twelve months at
exchange rates at an average of about US63.00 cents to A100 cents.


GYMPIE ELDORADO GOLD - GYMPIE, QUEENSLAND

NEW LEWIS MINE DEVELOPING RAPIDLY

Development of Gympie
'
s second modern gold mine, the Lewis Mine
commenced 19th May. Roche Mining has been appointed Mine Developer
and Operator, under a partnering contract. 

The Lewis Mine decline has advanced 530 metres and is advancing at
the rate of over 240 metres per month. The first ore target will be
reached after 2,200 metres of decline advance.

MECHANISATION OF MONKLAND MINE IS LOWERING COSTS 
&
 EXPANDING
PRODUCTION

Rubber-tyred diesel machinery and long-hole stoping have been
introduced on 12 Level and longhole stoping on 12, 13, 14 
&
 15
Levels. Over the last quarter, operating costs have fallen 43% to \$71
per tonne of ore and 30% to \$344 per ounce of gold.

STOCKWORK BLOCK 6A CONTAINS 124,000 OUNCES AT 12.1 G/T

Stockwork block 6A on 12 Level has been drilled, bulk sampled and
estimated at 320,000 tonnes at 12.1 g/t containing 124,000 ounces.
Block 6A is 62 metres long, 35 metres wide and over 60 metres high -
ideal for mechanised mining. A 2,000 tonne bulk sample milled
successfully, averaging 12 g/t grade and 91.2% recovery of gold.
Drilling is now targeting extensions and fault-offsets of the large
stockwork ore zone.

MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AWARD FOR WATER MANAGEMENT

The Australian Minerals and Energy Environmental Foundation (
"
AMEEF
"
)
has awarded us the environmental excellence award in the small/medium
company category 
"
for the pro-active and highly transparent approach
in managing the controlled discharge of gold mill tailings water into
the Mary River in an environmentally sensitive way
"
.

We acknowledge the assistance of the Qld Department of Minerals 
&

Energy, Southern Region environmental group, Professor Barry Noller
of the National Research Centre for Environmental Toxicology and Drs
Margaret Greenway and Heather Chapman of Griffith University
Environment 
&
 Public Health faculties, with whom we share this
prestigious award.

OVERVIEW

The business plan now being achieved at Gympie is to discover and
develop high-profit gold orebodies and ultimately to establish
several mines with average cash operating costs below \$A300/oz
(\$US200/oz) and total production costs below \$A350/oz (\$US230/oz).

During the quarter gold sales of 8113 ounces averaged \$521/oz
(\$US287/oz) price which generated a cash operating margin of \$177/oz.

Ore production this quarter was still constrained by accelerated
off-ore development congesting ore mining areas and disrupting shaft
hoisting capacity. This development work is well ahead of schedule
and is part of the mine expansion program that is transforming the
business to a predominantly mechanised mine using long-hole open
stoping, diesel-powered rubber-tyred loaders and other modern low
cost mining methods by the 4th Quarter of the 2000/01
financial year

HIGHLIGHTS

The Company
'
s major focus this quarter has been through our wholly
owned subsidiary Kings Diamonds International N.L. and their interest
in offshore alluvial Diamond Exploration in western South Africa.

During February and March our vessel has been intermittently
exploring on Concessions 5(a) and 6(a) adjacent to the De Beer
operated township of Kleinsee which is 80 kilometres south of our
home base of Port Nolloth. During this period with unseasonal
unsettled seas, together with vessel and plant modifications, our
exploration has been limited.

Exploration this quarter has restricted recovery to less than 80 only
25 kilogram bags of diamondiferous gravel concentrate. From these
gravels we have recovered 2.42 carats of rough diamonds. The unusual
weather pattern has not allowed the vessel to explore our concessions
on a regular basis or in areas where we know our results of recovery
will be better.

Company Directors, Bruce Hallt and Tony McDonald, visited South
Africa early in February 2000 to familiarise themselves with
operations and the conditions in and around the concession areas
south of Port Nolloth. During their visit they had profitable
meetings with Trans Hex, the owners of the Sea Concessions in which
Kings are working and other onshore diamond production companies.
Discussions with Trans Hex have allowed us to double our offshore
concession area with the offer to explore a new area. Concession
6(a). Concession 6(a) lies adjacent to 5(a), and collectively they
cover an area of 70 square kilometres. This new area is one which
larger quantities of diamonds have been recovered historically.
Concession 6(a) will allow Kings the opportunity to work high grade
diamondiferous gravel zones which our Joint Venture partner, Mr
Hector Bergstrom, has successfully worked over the past twenty years.

The Company late in the quarter sent Director Geologist, Mr Mike
Seed, to South Africa to further advance the offshore exploration
interests and investigate other offshore and onshore projects both on
the West Coast and in the Kimberley region. Mike Seed reports of
continuing heavy sea conditions and advises that during these periods
the company has continued to upgrade the vessel
'
s Performance and
also continues with routine maintenance.

Mr Seed has made contact with several South African Diamond Company
'
s
seeking Joint Venture partners to either assist in the current
diamond mining operations or in diamond exploration around existing
or recently mined reserves. A full report on the projects assessed 
will be outlined in the June Quarterly.

From exploration during September 1999 Quarter we had encouraging
assay results from our Mining tenements in Northern New South Wales.
The tenements Mountain Valley (EL5690) and Palerdome (EL5691) have
yielded encouraging assay results. Preliminary reconnaissance
sampling of EL5690 was carried out in December 1999. This
reconnaissance was successful in locating the historical Alpha
diggings where diamonds have previously been recovered. A total of 13
only 30 kilogram samples of tertiary gravels were collected and
processed to create 11.5 kilograms of heavy mineral concentrate. This
sample was submitted to Diatech in Western Australia for further
heavy media separation analysis and diamond identification. Recovery
of one gem stone quality diamond measuring 0.099 carats (0.0198
grams) was found in the concentrate.

The recovery of the diamond form gravel is encouraging and further
detailed sampling and mapping of this area is warranted. Time during
the third quarter of this year has been set aside for further
exploration on the area.

Texrise Pty Ltd, Kings wholly owned subsidiary, and Johnson
'
s Well
Mining N.L. (JWM) entered into a Sale Agreement during the quarter,
in which Texrise agreed to sell JWM their nine mining tenements in
the Duketon Belt in Western Australia. JWM have paid \$15,000 towards
a purchase price of \$115,000 for the tenements and are to pay the
remaining \$100,000 if and when they make a decision to mine their
adjoining 
"
Rosemont
"
 Mining lease. If no decisions to mine is made by
30 June 2000, JWM may extend that decision until 30 June 2002 by
paying a \$50,000 extension fee. Should JWM choose not to extend the
decision period or at the end of the extension at 30 June 2002 not
choose to mine, the tenements will revert back to Texrise.

In January the Company raised the sum of \$400,000 by way of the
issuing of Convertible Notes. These notes attracted an interest rate
of 8% and are available for conversion after the 31 March 2000. The
conversion was at a rate of \$0.04 per share. Towards the end of this
quarter, Kings further raised \$315,250 by way of placement. This
placement was made at \$0.065 by placing 4.85 million shares to raise
funds for further exploration and ongoing administration.

Project:  KLEINSEE                           Kings 38.3% 
Title:    Concessions 5a and 6a 
Location: West Coast South Africa (Near the Namibian Border) 
Setting:  Offshore Exploration/Mining up to 1 kilometre offshore 
Target:   Gemstone Quality Diamonds

Early in the quarter the Diamond Recovery and Exploration Vessel was
fitted out with Diamond Recovery Equipment. Toward the end of
February the vessel was able to commission its plant and perform sea
trials when weather permitted. During this period the vessel treated
15 tonnes of Sea Bed material from which 2 tonnes of diamondiferous
gravel concentrate was recovered. From this concentrate 2.42 carats
of gem quality diamonds were recovered on the first pass through
Trails Hex
'
s plant. This result indicated that diamonds were present
on Concession 5a. However these samples were taken at random in 15
metres of water whilst testing our equipment, and should not be
compared to the better results we expect whilst sampling our targeted
areas close inshore on Concession 6(a) which historically has
demonstrated better grades of recovery.

Unusual heavy seas still continue into the coming quarter, which
finds our vessel port-bound awaiting favourable conditions, the
company has decided to value add to their present offshore programme
by endeavouring to utilise there staff and equipment by developing
new close onshore projects.

Ardlethan Tin Mine, which includes:

* 53 mineral tenements containing significant tin resources

* buildings, some tin processing plant and equipment

* tailings dams and tin tailings

* a 53 km water pipeline and associated rights to draw water

* about 400 hectares of freehold land

* roads, pipelines and other services.

The agreed purchase price for the subsidiary is \$1.00 (One Dollar)
and Marlborough Resources Group will take over responsibility for
rehabilitation of the tailings, etc at the old tin project, which was
closed down in 1986. The tailings dams contain approximately 7.86
million tonnes of tailings at a grade of approximately 0.19% tin. So
there are approximately 15,000 tonnes of contained tin in the
tailings, with a current in-situ value of approximately A\$130
Million.

Marlborough
'
s metallurgical consultant, Mr Nick Moony, has conducted
several detailed studies of these tailings over the past twenty years
and determined that recoveries of between 55% and 68% may be possible
depending on the process selected. Based on this information,
Marlborough has estimated that the tailings treatment project will be
profitable at the current tin price.

Marlborough will be conducting further test work on site to determine
the most economical process and equipment to maximise profitability
from the treatment of tailings. There have been considerable
technological advances in processing equipment and tin fuming, since
these tailings were produced over the period 1964 to 1986.
Marlborough expects to profitably treat the majority of these tin
tailings, thereby recovering a substantial portion of the in-situ
value. The retreated tailings would then be dumped back into the
original open cut. 

In addition to the tailings, there are also significant alluvial tin
resources on some of the 53 mineral tenements. Marlborough had
planned to treat 1,220,000 bank cubic metres (bcm) of alluvial ore at
a grade of 1.59 kilogram of tin per bcm under an access agreement
which was previously announced. Now Marlborough will own these
resources (totalling 1,940 tonnes of contained tin) in its own right
and not have to make payments to any other company. The water
pipeline and water storage on the old Ardlethan Tin mine site will
also be useful to Marlborough for the development of its basic
project, which was announced on 20 January. The Feasibility Study
showed how that base project could produce:

* \$6,000,000 of profits over the first three years (before interest
and tax);

* \$14,000,000 of positive cash flow from operations (before interest
and tax);

* 57% per annum internal rate of return; and

* tin in concentrate for a cash operating cost of about A\$3,367 per
tonne over the first three years, compared with a net selling price
of A\$7,000 per tonne.

The additional resources, facilities and services from the old mine
will allow greater production and economies of scale. This should
result in a longer life project and additional profits. It should
also result in more employment, regional development and capital
investment.

Over the past two months, Marlborough has been negotiating with
Western Metals and Epoch Exploration Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of Kolback
Group Ltd) to acquire the old mine assets or the company holding
them. A complex deal was finally worked out this week, whereby
Marlborough acquired and exercised the option, which Epoch held, to
acquire the subsidiary company of Western Metals Ltd. Marlborough,
via its wholly owned subsidiary Telminex NL, was able to do this on
the condition that it granted a call option to Epoch to acquire the
subsidiary and some of its assets, if Kolback was successful in
obtaining all landfill development approvals. Under the agreements,
Marlborough would continue to have access to all the mineral
resources.

Marlborough intends to commence detailed design and construction of
its base project in April. Financing, marketing and environment work
is progressing well and it is hoped that all these aspects of the
base project will be completed in the next six months.

Test work on tailings and other newly acquired assets will also
commence this year, with the object of commencing tin concentrate
production in the year 2001 and expanding production as rapidly as
resources and services permit.

In conclusion, this acquisition is a major step forward for the
Marlborough Group. It represents more than a doubling of tin
resources, owned by the company, and should result in:

* significant increases in profit from the Ardlethan Tin Project; 

* longer mine life and commitments; 

* economies of scale and synergy with the high grade alluvial 
  project; 

* new regional development in central New South Wales; and

* higher levels of employment and capital investment.

I refer to the Form 603 - Initial Substantial Shareholder Notice
dated 26 April 2000 lodged by Macquarie Bank Limited on 27 April 2000
and the subsequent correcting Notice lodged on 28 April 2000.

Each Notice included the following relevant interests in Email
Limited:

Macquarie Bank Limited                      1,615,335
Macquarie Investment Management Limited       232,189

Due to a systems error, neither Macquarie Bank Limited nor Macquarie
Investment Management Limited held those relevant interests on the
date of the Notice. In consequence, the overall position of
Macquarie Bank Limited and its associates was overstated by
1,847,524. After correcting this error, Macquarie Bank Limited
'
s and
its associates
'
 relevant interest in Email Limited was below 5% on
the date of the Notice and accordingly, the requirement to lodge the
Substantial Shareholder Notice in accordance with the Corporations
Law was not triggered.

The relevant interest of Macquarie Bank Limited and its associates
currently remains below 5%.

Macquarie Bank Limited apologises for this error and any
inconvenience caused as a result of its incorrect reporting.

MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE GROUP
Sydney
Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Limited (MIIML), the
Manager of Macquarie Infrastructure Group (MIG), today confirmed that
Midland Expressway Limited (MEL), which is 50% owned by MIG, will
tender the design and construction contract for the Birmingham
Northern Relief Road (BNRR), the UK
'
s first toll road.

MEL believes that the decision to tender the contract, which involves
the construction of a 44 kilometre six lane expressway costing around
A\$1.2 billion, is unlikely to delay the opening date for the road.
MEL also believes this decision will produce the best financial
outcome for the project.

MIIML is concerned to ensure that the construction of the BNRR is
completed on time and to budget. MIIML believes that any delay at
this stage will improve the probability of that desired outcome it
is, therefore, in the best interests of unit holders.

The original construction agreement for the BNRR was with a joint
venture of a subsidiary of one of the original proponents of the
project, Kvaerner Constructions, and Italy
'
s Italstrade. These
parties have agreed to the tender taking place.

MAIN POINTS 

* An improving trend in the company
'
s financial performance
continued with a \$52.2 million operating profit following a \$1.8
million profit in the June 1999 half and a \$40.2 million loss in the
December 1998 half (all MIM
'
s share). 

* The gain was due to generally improved operational performances. 

* Overall, A\$ prices received had a negative impact on revenue 
compared with the December 1998 half though positive compared with 
the June 1999 half.

MIM
'
s share of total operating cashflow was \$450.3 million
comprising: 

* \$194.8 million from operating activities (\$236 million in the June 
1999 half and \$144 million in the December 1998 half.) 

* \$255.5 million from a one-off forward sale of silver announced last
month, which had virtually no impact on the operating profit. 

MIM
'
s share of total capital expenditure for the period was \$244.4 
million compared with \$248.1 million for the June 1999 half and \$378.5
million for the December 1998 half, reflecting a reduction in the
group
'
s major new project spending at Mount Isa. Sustaining capital
accounted for \$61.8 million, growth capital \$166.2 million and
exploration \$16.4 million. At Mount Isa, pre-commissioning of the
Enterprise copper mine was in progress at the end of the half.
Development of the George Fisher zinc-lead-silver mine was well
advanced with major upgrade work at the Mount Isa lead concentrator
completed during the half. Work on the copper smelter waste gas
capture project was largely completed. 

MIM
'
s share of total debt at 31 December 1999 declined to \$1.494 
billion (\$1.618 billion 30 June 1999). Proceeds from the forward sale 
of silver were applied to debt reduction. Gearing under MIM
'
s debt 
covenants (debt/debt + tangible net worth, excluding other 
participants
'
 interests in the Alumbrera and Ernest Henry projects) 
consequently declined to 40.3% (45.1% at 31 December 1998 and 43.2% 
at 30 June 1999). 

Net profit of \$107.3 million included profit from abnormal items of
\$55.1 million being principally: 

* tax benefit of \$36.2 million arising from the restatement of 
deferred tax balances as a consequence of the Australian company 
income tax rate change to 34% applicable from 1 July 2000, and then 
to 30% applicable from 1 July 2001; and 

* tax benefit of \$20.4 million arising from settlement with the 
Australian Taxation Office of claims for the Research and Development 
taxation concession mainly for periods prior to 30 June 1990. Claims 
for the concession for later years remain under review. 

PRODUCTION 

Mount Isa
'
s copper smelter continued to increase output. Total group 
copper production was higher than the December 1998 half although 
below the June 1999 half total due mainly to reduced mill 
availability, lower grades of ore treated and lower metallurgical
recoveries at Alumbrera. 

Group lead production increased; zinc production, which had risen in 
the June 1999 half, declined to December 1998 levels mainly due to 
lower grades of ore treated at Mount Isa. 

Group coal production continued at a high level; Collinsville output 
was reduced in response to market conditions. Operating problems at 
Oaky North underground longwall adversely affected Oaky Creek
'
s 
December quarter run of mine production. 

SALES, PRICES AND EXCHANGE RATE 

MIM
'
s share of sales volumes for all products was higher than in the 
December 1998 half although lower, for all but lead, than in the June 
1999 half. 

US\$ prices of copper, zinc and gold recovered from the extremely low 
levels of the June 1999 half to exceed those of the December 1998 
half. However the metal price gains since the December 1998 half were 
diluted by the strengthening A\$. The net effect of prices on MIM, 
compared with the December 1998 half, was negative as the small 
increases in A\$ average prices received for copper, zinc and silver 
were outweighed by reductions in coal, lead and gold prices. 

MIM
'
s share of sales revenue was \$1386.6 million (June 1999 half 
\$1422.8 million, December 1998 half \$1303.6 million). Sales revenue 
includes realised currency and commodity hedging gains for the 
December half of the year amounting to A\$13.7 million.

DIVIDENDS 

Directors have declared an interim dividend of 1.25 cents per share 
(unfranked) totalling \$21 million, payable on 27 March 2000 to 
shareholders registered on 3 March 2000. The 1998/99 interim dividend 
was 1.25 cents per share (unfranked) totalling \$21
million

approach, and as such, the agreement between the two organisations
has been terminated.

Clive Flory, the General Manager of INWW, said 
'
Clearly we are
disappointed about the termination of the arrangement as we had
developed a very good relationship with Namezero, having registered
a significant number of names for it over the past few months.
However, we understand the financial imperatives under which they are
operating. We continue our efforts to attract other volume users of
domain names and have significantly increased the number of channel
partner relationships in recent months, both within Australia and
internationally.

million of shares in the new subsidiary at an issue price of 20 cents
per share.

Minotaur proposes to distribute the shares it will then hold in the
newly created subsidiary by way of a distribution in specie to
Minotaur shareholders.

Minotaur proposes that Minotaur Exploration Ltd will issue a
prospectus to raise \$0.75m to fund all of its base metal joint

of 20 cents each, be exercisable on or before 31 December 2001 and
will have the same terms and conditions as the existing Minotaur
options which the company has on issue.

Ltd.

The funds will be used to facilitate the subscription by Minotaur for
shares in its newly created wholly owned subsidiary, Minotaur
Exploration Ltd, which will be formed to hold the company
'
s base
metals assets.

The placement is conditional on obtaining shareholder approval under
Listing Rule 7.1.

MEDIA RELEASE

100 JOBS TO BE CREATED IN PROPOSED \$20 MILLION TELECOMMUNICATIONS
INVESTMENT FOR BENDIGO

WORLD
'
S BEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FACILITIES ON OFFER FOR BENDIGO

A planning permit was lodged last Thursday with the Greater City of
Bendigo for a \$20 million telecommunications investment in Bendigo,
which will see up to 100 construction jobs and 50 full time jobs
created.

Mildura based Neighborhood Cable, Australia
'
s largest regional
supplier of telecommunications services, submitted the application to
Council to establish a Broadband Fibre-Optic Cable Network system for
Bendigo
'
s 85,000 residents.

The project will involve an investment of \$20 million and greatly
improve telecommunications services to Bendigo and surrounding areas
at substantially lower cost.

The services to be provided over the state of-the-art network will
include broadband Internet access via high speed cable modem, free
local telephone calls, untimed long distance calls, up to 32 channels
of Pay TV, flat rate dial-up internet access, citywide
videoconferencing and video-on-demand.

As well, a number of advanced broadband applications will be
available, such as virtual private networking for business,
educational and government use, high-speed on-line video games and
information, tourism and educational resources.

This will mean that Bendigo will have world
'
s best information
technology facilities.

Should the application be approved, building of this network will
commence immediately and begin operating from March 2001.

Neighborhood Cable Managing Director John Freeman says that the
investment will create substantial benefits for Bendigo and
surrounding communities.


"
The network will offer state-of-the-art telecommunications services
equal to or better than any others available elsewhere in Australia
or internationally.


"
Under our proposal, only local people will be hired and trained for
the construction and operation of the network and its services,
providing them with long term skills. 


"
Unlike some telecommunications service providers, we believe in
training our own staff rather than bringing already trained
technicians in from overseas, resulting in little if any local skills
transferal.


"
Those who receive this training will secure skills that are
recognisable around the world.


"
Under the application to Council, the network will be installed in
central and outer Bendigo.


"
These services might, in due course, be extended into neighboring
areas such as Maryborough, Castlemaine, Avoca, and Daylesford.


"
This would allow untimed calls to be made over or between numerous
regional locations greatly improving communication access across the
state.
"


Mr Freeman said that in terms of the application to council, the
network would be rolled out to service all of Bendigo from Eaglehawk
to Spring Gully, Kangaroo Flat to Epsom. 


"
Our network has been operating in Mildura and Ballarat for several
years with considerable success. There, business, educational,
government and residential users surf the Internet at over 200 times
faster than they ever did before, at lower cost.


"
They are also able to watch more Pay TV for less and will soon be
paying substantially lower telephone bills. Schools, government and
business users now use the internet as a powerful competitive tool
often using more data in one day than they previously used in a
month,
"
 he said.


"
Despite its remoteness, Mildura businesses are already winning
contracts from far afield because of its superior telecommunications
infrastructure, such as citywide videoconferencing.


"
Citywide broadband capability will be a boost to existing cable
television service providers and emerging ones such as BenTel who
will now be able to offer a range of broadband services at
substantially lower costs both in Bendigo and across Victoria.


"
We are very excited at the prospect of offering these facilities to
the residents of Bendigo,
"
 Mr Freeman said.

Neighborhood Cable commenced operations in November 1994 and now
operates in Mildura and Ballarat with plans to operate in other
regional centres.

The company plans to have Broadband Cable Networks operating to
250,000 regional Victorians in Mildura, Ballarat, Bendigo and Albury
Wodonga by the end of next year. Neighborhood Cable commenced trading
on the Australian Stock Exchange in April this year.

Nido Petroleum Philippines Pty Ltd reports that it has withdrawn from
block GSEC-84, Cagayan Basin, Luzon, in the Philippines.

Nido initially held a 10% interest in the block. In early 2000, Nido
negotiated a farm down of its interest to 2.5% in exchange for a full
carry through the drilling of the Fuga-1 well. The well was drilled
in May 2000 and was not successful in finding commercial
hydrocarbons. Following the drilling of the well and a review of the
remaining prospectivity, Nido has elected to withdraw from the
permit. All expenses associated with the block were written off at
June 30, 2000.

OPTISCAN IMAGING LIMITED
Melbourne
Optiscan is pleased to report that The Alfred Hospital ethics
committee has approved a trial of Optiscan
'
s miniaturised microscope
technology in the non-invasive diagnosis, differentiation and
monitoring of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin lesions.

Psoriasis alone involves annual US treatment expenditure of US\$2.9
billion. Some of the limitations in managing sufferers of psoriasis
and other inflammatory skin conditions relate to difficulties in
accurate diagnosis and identifying disease progression.

Optiscan
'
s technology magnifies skin cells 2000 times without the
need for biopsies. Digital images appear in real time on a computer
screen, offering immediate diagnosis with cellular precision.

Optiscan
'
s technology enjoys a growing realm of applications, with
the impending release of its first clinical product, being a hand
held probe for dermatology. The trial is representative of this
progression, which will be important in the positioning of Optiscan
'
s
first product and maximising its desirability to medical
practitioners.

The trial is to be conducted by Associate Professor John Kelly, The
Alfred Hospital (Melbourne), and is expected to commence in the
coming weeks.

Optiscan
'
s hand held probe is also targeted at applications in the
biopsy free detection and monitoring of skin cancer and burn depth
analysis. A flexible endoscopic version is also being developed for
applications in detection of colon cancer and other gastrointestinal
disorders.

PALADIN INDUSTRIAL TRUST
Sydney
Paladin Industrial Trust
'
s attractive buildings and good asset
management are continuing to quickly attract quality tenants without
loss of rental income.

Two recently signed tenants are new to the Trust
'
s portfolio which is
currently 99.6 per cent leased. The third is a current tenant who has
taken a new lease for a further three years.

The new lease terms, showing an average three per cent increase on
previous rentals, continue to ensure security of PID
'
s rental income.

Richard Stacey, Trust Manager - Industrial for Paladin Australia
Limited, PID
'
s responsible entity, said the Trust is having no
trouble attracting new tenants.


'
We are retaining or quickly finding new tenants for our properties
with impending lease expiries, without suffering any vacancy
periods,
'
 he said.


'
I believe it
'
s because the PID management team is focused on
actively managing and improving our assets to ensure they present
well and have good functionality - two important tenant requirements.


'
Because we understand the market and manage our assets to make them
attractive to businesses, we
'
ve been able to strike good deals
quickly, without vacancy periods, thus ensuring the security of our
rental income.
'


Details of the three leases are as follows:

Unit 4, 154 O
'
Riordan Street, Mascot, New South Wales

The Trust negotiated a new five-year lease with a two-year option, to
new tenant Transfield Pty Ltd. The lease from 1 January 2000 is at a
rental of \$79,338 per annum net, or \$125 per square metre net. Rent
increases are annual by the greater of CPI or three per cent, with a
review to the greater of market, CPI or three per cent at the start
of 2002.

To facilitate this new lease the Trust negotiated a lease surrender
for existing tenant, Winsome International Pty Ltd, whose lease was
due to expire on 15 March 2001. In surrendering this lease the Trust
achieved a 6.6 per cent rental increase, coupled with the benefit of
securing another high quality tenant on a long lease term into the
Estate.

Transfield Pty Ltd is a privately owned Australian company acting as
a developer, owner, operator and provider for major projects in
construction, infrastructure, telecommunications, defence and
maintenance services. It has more than eight thousand employees and
generates an annual turnover in excess of A\$1.7 billion. 

Unit 1, 2 Picken Street, Silverwater, New South Wales

existing tenant, VFJ Electronics Pty Limited, on this 1,225 square
metre unit in Picken Street.

The new rental is \$143,074 per annum net or \$116.80 per square metre
net, a four per cent increase on its previous rental. Reviews are to
the greater of CPI or four per cent at the end of the second year.

VFJ Electronics Pty Limited is a designer and manufacturer of
smartcard-related products for the Australian and Asian markets. It
'
s
a wholly owned subsidiary of Omnitech Holdings Limited, an
electronics components manufacturer listed on the Australian Stock

'
s
portfolio. It took up the lease on this 9,401 square mete building
comprising 45 square metres of office and 9,356 square metres of
warehouse on 15 February 2000.

The new one-year lease is at a rental of \$538,140 per annum net, or
\$57.24 per square metre net for this property which forms part of the
Trust
'
s three-building industrial estate in Salisbury, a southern
suburb of Brisbane. The new rental is 2.3 per cent higher than paid
by previous tenant, Mayne Nickless Ltd, whose lease expired on 14
February 2000.

Carter Holt Harvey is one of the largest forest products companies in
the Southern Hemisphere with operations spanning New Zealand,
Australia and Chile. Carter Holt Harvey Australia Pty Ltd is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Carter Holt Harvey Limited, the wood, paper,
tissue and packaging manufacturer listed on both the Australian and

PID is delighted to have attracted such credible tenants to its
portfolio, which also removes any short term vacancy exposure to the
Brisbane and Sydney industrial markets.

PACMIN MINING CORPORATION LIMITED
Perth
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

* PRODUCTION OF 39,300 OUNCES FROM TARMOOLA

As forecast in the previous quarter, gold production was reduced as a
result of the current planned phase of waste removal to access ore
from higher levels in the pit being coordinated with the completion
of ore removal from lower levels and the treatment of low-grade
stockpiles. Production is expected to return to normal sustainable
levels as run-of-mine reserve grade ore is accessed upon completion
of the current waste removal phase.

* CASH OPERATING COSTS

Record mill throughput and lower mining costs contributed to further
cost reductions, enabling cash operating costs to be contained at
A$336 per ounce (US$189 per ounce) for the quarter, despite the lower
average grade ore feed treated through the Tarmoola mill.

* CELTIC AND WONDER NORTH PROJECTS

During the quarter, scheduled resource definition drilling and pit
optimisation work focused on the nearby high-grade satellite
deposits at Celtic and Wonder North. This work has confirmed a
reserve of 700,000 tonnes at 3.15 g/t containing 71,000 ounces of
gold at the Celtic Project, reflecting a high 88% conversion to
reserves from the previous resource. The orebody is located on a
granted mining lease within a 30km trucking distance of the Tarmoola
Mill. Mining of this satellite orebody will commence at the end of
October in line with the budget production schedule, and will provide
high-grade ore feed for the Tarmoola mill.

Resource evaluation drilling has commenced on the Wonder North
project located 5km north of Celtic. It is considered there is
excellent potential for a similar upgrade in resources and reserves
to that achieved at Celtic.

* TARMOOLA EXPLORATION

GALAHAD

A new high grade zone of mineralisation has been identified
immediately to the south of the Tarmoola south pit. High grade
mineralisation has been drilled to a depth of approximately 80m.
Intercepts close to surface include 8m @ 42.9g/t from 22m, 5m @
38.5g/t from 25m, 3m @ 21.9g/t from 15m and 2m @ 17.2g/t from 19m.

NORTH EASTERN EXTENSION (NEX) 

The North Eastern Extension (NEX) is defined as the zone of flat
lying mineralisation associated with the granite contact that plunges
north of the current Tarmoola North pit. The intersection of this
zone and the steeper Eastern Flank has typically produced zones of
thickened, higher grade mineralisation. A program of step out
diamond holes planned to test this position north of existing
drilling intersected strong mineralisation that included 7m @
7.73g/t, 10m @ 4.34g/t and 8.4m @ 13.8g/t. These results are
interpreted as being related to the NEX, meaning that the targeted
intersection of the two mineralised zones remains to be tested.

* CAROSUE DAM PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

The project remains within schedule and budget estimates with
engineering design and procurement complete. All major equipment
items are on-site with the exception of the mill motor, which is
expected in October. It is anticipated that plant commissioning will
commence in November 2000. Mining infrastructure including
maintenance workshops, offices and fuel farms have been installed.
Contract mining commenced in early July 2000. Waste mining is on
schedule with approximately 1.9 million cubic metres being mined to
the end of September

QUEENSLAND CAPITAL CORPORATION LIMITED
Brisbane
RESPONSE TO ASX QUERY

In response to your price query of 27 July 2000, Queensland Capital
Corporation Limited (
"
QCC
"
) advises as follows:

1. No - there is no information concerning QCC that has not been
announced which, if known, would explain the recent trading in QCC
shares. In that context, the Exchange should note the announcement
made by the Company on 27 July 2000 updating the market on current
status of projects and commenting on the expected results for the
year to 30 June 2000.

Both the recent financial results of QCC and the fact that QCC is
undertaking a strategic review of its business and of the future
opportunities available to it have been well documented. While it is
not the intention of QCC
'
s directors to comment on market speculation
(as reflected in the recent increase in the price of QCC
'
s share),
the directors can confirm that a number of alternatives for QCC to
address its recent financial and market performance are presently
under consideration.

An announcement concerning QCC
'
s future plans will be made to the
market when it is appropriate to do so (and in compliance with
Listing Rule 3.1).

2. Not applicable.

3. QCC has no reason to believe that the operating profit/loss before
abnormal items and income tax for the year ended 30 June 2000 will
vary by more than 15% from the previous announcements made by QCC.

4. QCC has no reason to believe that it will record any material 
abnormal or extraordinary profit/loss for the financial year ended 
30 June 2000.

5. Except for the market speculation referred to above, QCC is not
able to provide any other explanation for the price change and the
increase in the volume of trading in its securities.

6. Yes, QCC and its directors are fully aware of the need for
compliance with the Listing Rules, and in particular, the need to
disclose information as required by Listing Rule 3.1. You can be
assured that QCC is currently in compliance with Listing Rule 3.1 and
will continue to comply with its obligations in that regard.

We trust that the above sufficiently address the Exchange
'
s concerns
regarding QCC
'
s recent share price increase.

QCT RESOURCES LIMITED
Brisbane
BHP Coal Pty Ltd, Manager of the Central Queensland Coal Associates
(CQCA) and Gregory Joint Ventures, has reached agreement with the
Japanese Steel Mills (JSM) on prices for QCT Resources
'
 shipments of
hard coking coals from the Joint Venture mines for the Japanese
fiscal year commencing 1 April 2000. QCT Resources has 32.37%
interests in the Joint Ventures.

Prices for the range of hard coking coals sold by the Joint Venturers
will be reduced by an average of 5% from current prices. The Joint
Venturers
'
 market position in Japan is expected to strengthen during
the new Japanese fiscal year, however.

The prices negotiated reflect fundamentals of supply and demand for
hard coking coal by the JSM, and should not be regarded as an
indicator for prices to be negotiated for other coal qualities in
Asian and other world markets.

Agreements for the supply of coking coal to Japanese customers from
the Group
'
s wholly-owned South Blackwater mine have yet to be
negotiated.

SMART COMMUNICATIONS GROUP LIMITED
Sydney
RESPONSE TO ASX QUERY

Reference is made to your correspondence of 1 November 2000 regarding
the Quarterly Report for Smart Communications Group Limited (
"
Smart
Communications
"
) in the form of Appendix 4C for the period ended 30
September 2000.

As mentioned on the phone yesterday, we have included a
reconciliation of the use of funds from the IPO at item 1.26 of our
4C report to detail the one-off items in the quarter. We also made a
related announcement to the ASX on 1 November 2000 to further clarify
our report, in compliance with listing rule 3.1.

Regarding the specific matters you raise:

1. Any such conclusion would be erroneous for the following reasons:

The negative net operating cash flow of \$2.015 million included
several non-recurring items as follows:

* \$1.064 million related to capital raising costs of the company
'
s
initial public offering in August 2000 which delivered net proceeds
to the company in the quarter concerned of approximately \$6.0
million. This is clearly a non-recurring item and is in accordance
with the expenditure program previously submitted to the ASX.

* \$1.213 million related to increased debtors. Approximately \$0.45
million of this increase is a consequence of the GST, which is also a
one-off effect. The balance reflects business growth and a lag in
collections, which were affected at the end of September by the
Olympics. These will subsequently be accounted for in increased
receipts during the December Quarter.

A reconciliation of the movement in debtors is as follows:

Revenue September Qtr       \$6,269k 
GST Invoiced                  \$627k 
Total                       \$6,896k
Receipts from Customers
 (incl June Qtr)            \$5,683k 
Debtors Movement            \$1,213k

* \$198k relating to product research and development in accordance
with the expenditure program previously submitted to the ASX. This
expenditure is expected to translate into sales during the subsequent
quarter.

The Net Operating cash flow could be restated as follows:

Cash generated from Trading        \$480k
Capital Raising IPO Costs       (\$1,064k)
Debtors Increase                (\$1,213k) 
R
&
D                               (\$198k) 
Other Working Capital Movements    (\$20k) 
Total                           (\$2,015k)

This clearly shows that the fundamental business is profitable and is
generating a positive cash flow and that a large part of the negative
cash flow resulted from one-off items. The cash generated from
profits in future quarters is anticipated to be in accordance with
our Prospectus and to continue to increase each quarter. Therefore we
expect to have sufficient cash reserves to fund our activities well
into the future.

2. See above. The company has a 13-year history of generating
profits. It is continuing to generate increasing profits and
therefore a positive cash flow to fund operations.

3. Revenues for the September quarter are in line with forecasts.
Expenditures were marginally higher than initially anticipated due to
costs associated with the IPO and the expansion of the company.
Profits for the September quarter were above those of the previous
quarter.

4. The company is expecting substantial growth this year in line with
the Prospectus revenue and profit targets. The company is currently
expanding in terms of personnel, training, resources and the sourcing
and development of products and services to achieve these targets,
While doing so it is continuing to also increase margins and profits.
At this stage we have no reason to believe that forecast revenue and
profit will not be achieved for the 2000/2001 year.

5. Yes.

6. The above response provides the information to satisfy the ASX
that the company does currently and will continue to comply with
listing Rule 12.2.

STAR MINING CORPORATION NL
Adelaide
The Board of Directors of Star Mining Corporation NL (Star Mining)
report for the quarter to 31st March 2000 follows:

During the period the placement of a further 165,000,000 ordinary
shares in the Company was arranged by D 
&
 D Tolhurst Ltd to raise
\$825,000 for working capital at a placement fee of 3% of the gross
proceeds.

At the meeting of Shareholders held on November 29th 1999 approval was
given, inter alia, for the Company to proceed with the Debt
Settlement Agreement which resolved the debt due to the Standard Bank
London Limited (Standard) leaving the Company substantially debt
free.

The signing of all related agreements was concluded on the 27th
March 2000 including a Power of Attorney appointing Standard as the
manager of the Russian mining assets with authority to negotiate the
disposal of each of these assets.

Star retains the right, under the agreements to 90% of any surplus
funds received from the disposal of these mining assets after payment
of the bank debt agreed. Should the final disposal of these assets
fail to settle the previous debt Standard will write off any
shortfall.

As previously advised the Board has continued to consider new
projects which will provide a sustainable future for the Company.

Following the previous experience of the Company in Russia the Board
believes that shareholder interests would be better served if future
investment by Star Mining was directed towards the broadening of both
the Company
'
s location and scope of activities. When the Board
reaches a decision on the future direction of the Company an
announcement will be made subject to the Listing Rules, the
requirements of the Australian Stock Exchange and any necessary
Shareholder approvals.

In view of the various circumstances detailed above the Company was
not in a position to carry out exploration activities during the
current quarter.

SONS OF GWALIA LIMITED

QUARTERLY OVERVIEW 
GOLD DEVELOPMENT

AT THE SONS OF GWALIA MINE:

* Stoping around old workings on the Main Lode commenced and, whilst
conditions have been difficult, the new mining method is providing
some initial encouragement with improved ground stability and access
noted in the first stopes accessed. High rainfall affected
underground operations during the quarter.

* Development focussed on extending the decline and the next two
levels. Development also commenced on the next phase of South Gwalia
Series Stopes.

* Infill drilling was completed during the quarter with excellent
results returned from the South Gwalia Series including 21 metres @
9.89 g/t gold and 7.95 metres @ 24.15 g/t gold.

* The Harlech Pit was successfully mined and pre-stripping has
commenced in the McGrath pit.

* Red October commenced ore production with a significant stockpile
established. However, high rainfall in the quarter affected
subsequent haulage to the Leonora plant. Approximately 10,000 ounces
in stockpiles were built up during the quarter at Red October and
Harlech as deliveries to the Sons of Gwalia Mill were hampered by
rain.

* Good drilling results along strike to the south of Red October
including 16 metres @ 25.76 g/t and 4 metres @ 6.1 g/t gold.

IN THE SOUTHERN CROSS REGION:

* Heavy rain at Yilgarn Star caused flooding of the lower levels of 
the underground mine and restricted ore haulage from Southern Star.

* At the Marvel Loch Operations rain and resultant minor wall slips 
restricted access to the North Pit. Higher grade ore is now available 
for the June quarter.

* Excellent exploration results at Golden Pig including 4.0 metres @ 
38.8 g/t gold, 2.5 metres @ 31.1 g/t gold and 4.0 metres @ 15.6 g/t 
gold. Ore reserves have again increased.

* Encouraging drilling results from the Nevoria Mine included 9.6 
metres @ 6.7 g/t gold and 4.2 metres @ 11.41 g/t gold.

* Good potential for underground extensions at Ruapehu with latest 
drilling which includes 3.5 metres @ 28.6 g/t gold and 3.6 metres @ 
17.8 g/t gold.

* Further sampling of old stockpiles has extended ore treatment at the
Bullfinch plant to beyond June 2000.

VICTORIA PETROLEUM NL
Adelaide
Victoria Petroleum NL, as Operator for the PRA 436 Joint Venture,
advises that the Cadart-l exploration well is at a depth of 1,748
meters and coring ahead in 70mm NQ hole in non-reservoir
shale/siltstone/coal seal cap lithologies. Due to the objectives
being deeper than predicted, the proposed total depth of the well has
been extended to 2,000 metres.

The live oil and gas shows seen to date in fractures in the seal
rocks are considered encouraging for the Gouaro Prospect as they
confirm the presence of oil and gas migrating through the Gouaro
Prospect at the Cadart-1 location.

Victoria Petroleum NL and Sun Resources NL, through farmout to
private US investor clients of Monoco Petroleum, Inc. and direct
participation, each have a partially free-carried 24.065% interest in
the Cadart-1 well, drilling on the Gouaro Anticline.

Cadart-1 will test the oil and gas potential of the Gouaro Anticline,
a surface anticline, estimated from seismic interpretation of the
1995 Gouaro seismic data, to have the most likely case potential to
contain 592 billion cubic feet of gas or 369 million barrels of oil
up to a maximum of 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas or 952 million
barrels of oil, if hydrocarbons are present.

Well Name:                   Cadart-1
Basin:                       New Caledonia Basin

E Proposed 
Total Depth:                 2,000 metres 
Reservoir Targets:           Cretaceous sandstones.
Time of Reporting:           0300 hrs WST 5th January, 2000
Well Depth:                  1748 metres
Hydrocarbon Indications:     Background gas only.
Operations last period:      Cored ahead in 70mm NQ hole
Operations next 24 hours:    Core ahead in 70mm NQ hole towards 
                             revised total depth of 2000 M.

Victoria Petroleum NL considers the prospects for oil and gas
exploration in New Caledonia are encouraging in view of the
hydrocarbon shows seen in previous shallow drilling, the current oil
and gas shows in Cadart-1, seismic anomalies possibly indicating the
presence of hydrocarbons at the Cadart-1 drill location, and the
upgrading of the oil and gas potential of the New Caledonia Basin by
the recent French government discovery of the worlds largest gas
deposit in the New Caledonia Basin.

The extremely strong market demand for any locally discovered and
produced hydrocarbons to replace the current 2 million barrels of
diesel and fuel oil imported each year to generate electricity for
New Caledonia provide a ready market for any discovery made.

GPS NETWORK EVENT TIMING AWARDED AUSTRALIAN PATENT 

Tele-IP Ltd announced today it has been granted an Australian patent
for the unique application of Global Positioning Satellite (GPS)
technology as a means of timing and managing events in large
telecommunications and utility networks.

Listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in October 1999, Tele-IP is
an Australian information technology and telecommunications solutions
provider that commercialises emerging opportunities in network
management, operational support systems and SNMP remote management 
systems.

The GPS technology is a unique feature of the Merlin network
management solution developed by Tele-IP which, together with the
company
'
s Remote Site Controller affords precision timing of events
across telecommunication networks of any size, ensuring network
operators superior levels of service and network availability. 

The new patent provides Tele-IP exclusivity in the application of GPS
technology for determining event timing in telecomnunications
networks.

In recent times, the telecommunications and utility sectors have seen
the creation of huge interconnected communications networks, often
with complex management and information handling problems. Ever
increasing network size and complexity results in increased event and
alarm volumes, ultimately producing 
'
alarm storms
'
 of many thousands
of reports during times of network failure.

Such 
'
storms
'
 can easily bring down the most sophisticated event
processing system through overload, completely destroying a company
'
s
ability to quickly diagnose and respond to such a crisis. As a
result, network service level agreements may be compromised with
significant cost implications.


"
The key to providing high availability Operations Support System
(OSS) functionality is to prevent unimportant event alarms ever
reaching the host,
"
 explained Tele-IP
'
s Chairman Andrew Martin, 
"
and
to ensure alarm flow is managed in a user-controlled manner.
"
 

The Merlin OSS solution takes a new approach to network management,
by realising higher levels of automation and faster software-enabled
fault resolution processes. This ensures users focus on service and
business outcomes, rather than technical issues. The GPS timing gives
Merlin the ability to accurately locate the primary fault.

Where legacy OSS systems struggle to synchronise time clocks located
at different network locations, GPS provides a refreshing
alternative. 
"
The use of a synchronised GPS timing system allows
events originating from the next building - or indeed halfway round
the world - to be stamped with a common time reference,
"
 continued
Martin. 
"
GPS timing is accurate to within one micro-second, allowing
the event time stamps to be used to accurately determine their origin
and sequence.
"


As a result, said Martin, network events can now be accurately
sorted and diagnosed. 
"
Root causes can be quickly identified and
action taken based on a precise diagnosis, since the accuracy of GPS
timing exceeds any other system available today. This is a powerful
enhancement of our Merlin platform and important differentiator in
the OSS market,
"
 he concluded. 

ABOUT MERLIN 

Merlin is an advanced combination of hardware, software and
integration services providing a fully integrated network management
system designed to support the widest range of communications
networks including telecommunications and broadcast systems.

Merlin brings together advanced topologically based fault analysis
with precision global satellite timing of network events, and
provides a strong layer of standardisation enabling the integration
of diverse equipment and technologies into a common data structure.
The analysis of this data allows organisations to focus on business
and service outcomes rather than the technical parameters of the
network.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

Timbercorp Limited, Australia
'
s leading agribusiness investment
management company, today announced a net profit after tax of \$55.1
million for the financial year ended 30 June 2000, a 206 per cent
increase over the \$18 million profit recorded for the previous year.

Directors have declared a final fully franked dividend of 4 cents per
share, compared with 2 cents fully franked for the previous
corresponding period. Total dividend for the year is 7 cents a share
compared with 3.5 cents in 1998/99.

Timbercorp chief executive officer Mr Robert Hance said: 
"
The result
reflects continuing strong demand for eucalypt treefarm investments
and a significant contribution from the company
'
s olive project.
"


Timbercorp
'
s management fee income increased substantially, from
\$46.7m to \$129.1m.

In previous years, management fee income has been brought to account
in the financial year following the sale. The Ralph changes,
announced in November 1999, require that revenues now be brought to
account in the year of sale. This year
'
s result therefore combines
contributions from the company
'
s 1999 and 2000 eucalypt projects and
2000 olive project.


"
As a result of the Ralph changes the company expects sales to be
more evenly distributed throughout the year. This should have a
positive impact on Timbercorp
'
s operations, as it will allow better
scheduling of the provision of services,
"
 Mr Hance said.

Importantly the Ralph review has maintained 100 per cent tax
deductibility for the company
'
s agribusiness investments.


"
The Ralph changes have been very positive for the company. There are
now fewer comparable products in the marketplace and demand for our
products remains strong,
"
 Mr Hance said.

The 1999/2000 result also reflects a significant contribution from
the company
'
s newly established olives project at Boort in Central
Victoria. The first 362 hectares of olives have been established
following full subscription to a private offering. Timbercorp will
make its first public offering of interests in its olive project in
October 2000.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

Timbercorp Limited is a fully integrated agribusiness investment
management company with interests in all stages of the agribusiness
cycle from project finance and funds management to on-farm project
delivery, crop harvesting, processing and sales.

Timbercorp
'
s first eucalypt plantations, established in 1993, are now
approaching maturity. By 2003 Timbercorp expects to be harvesting 500
hectares per year of treefarms as it scales up to full production of
10,000 hectares by 2008. In addition, Timbercorp expects to become a
major domestic processor of olives, producing a range of olive oils
and value-added products.

In early calendar 2000 Timbercorp restructured the management of its
operating businesses to reflect the level of maturity of its treefarm
business and the diversification into horticultural crops such as
olives and almonds.

A BUSINESS MODEL DESIGNED FOR GROWTH

The changes introduced following the Ralph review of business
taxation fundamentally changed the company
'
s cash flow requirements.
The effect of these changes has been that the company must expend
substantial funds relating to a project some 12 months sooner than
was previously required.

There are two positive outcomes of the Ralph changes. The first is
that they confirmed the availability of a 100 per cent tax deduction
for agricultural based investments to the extent services are
provided in the year of expenditure. The second is that the
requirement to incur expenditure at an earlier stage in the cycle has
led to less competition in Timbercorp
'
s traditional markets. 

In recognition of these changes, Timbercorp restructured its business
model, commencing with three major initiatives.

First, Timbercorp is close to finalising the securitisation of a
portion of its loan book. The proceeds from this securitisation, some
\$50 million to \$55 million, are expected to be received by October
2000. More importantly, the securitisation facility will be available
for loans originated in future projects.

Second, the company announced in February 2000 that it would offer
stapled securities in an associated company, Plantation Land Limited.
Plantation Land Limited holds title to a number of the company
'
s
plantation properties and to date has raised some \$24 million in long
term

 funding.

Third, it is the intention of the company to continue to use
innovative financing options to fund the continuing acquisition of
land and infrastructure. To date, the company is close to concluding
an arrangement for the sale and leaseback of some \$20 million of
forestry land and entering into a funding arrangement for its
horticulture land and infrastructure.

The company
'
s balance sheet at 31 December 2000 will reflect these
developments.

Combined, these initiatives will free up a significant portion of
cash later this financial year, as the company
'
s operations will be
strongly cash flow positive. This will fund strong growth in the
company
'
s operations into the future as well as lead to a capacity
for Directors to increase the dividend payout ratio to shareholders.

FORESTRY OPERATIONS

Timbercorp is one of Australia
'
s largest forestry services
contractors. In 1999/2000, Timbercorp established some 25,000
hectares of eucalypt treefarms. Accordingly, Timbercorp
'
s forestry
services operations increased their contribution to net profit by 235
per cent to \$38.1 million.

Timbercorp now manages more than 60,000 hectares of eucalypt
treefarms in southwest Western Australia and the Green Triangle
region of Victoria/South Australia.

In the face of strong competition, Timbercorp filled its land
requirements for its 2000 project and has acquired some 8,000
hectares in the Green Triangle region for its 2001 project.
Timbercorp
'
s approach to land prices is based on protection of
shareholder and grower returns. The company is constantly assessing
new areas for plantation establishment.

Following year-end, Timbercorp announced that it would expand its
treefarm business into Tasmania by entering an agreement with Rio
Tinto subsidiary North Forest Products to establish more than 1,000
hectares a year of eucalypt treefarms

HORTICULTURE

Timbercorp is developing a large-scale olive business at Boort in
Central Victoria. The company has already established an initial 362
hectares of olives and expects to develop a further 1,000 hectares in
2001.

In its first year of operation, Timbercorp
'
s olive operation
contributed \$4.7 million to net profit after tax. Olives are expected
to increase their contribution to earnings in 2000/01 as the company
offers its substantially larger 2001 olive project to growers.

Following year-end, Timbercorp announced an expansion into the almond
industry. Together with its 25% partner, the company expects to
establish some 4,000 hectares of almonds over the next five years,
making an important contribution to earnings from 2000/01.

The diversification into horticultural crops will enable Timbercorp
to apply its significant agribusiness expertise to new value-adding
activities.
                  
TECHNOLOGY

Timbercorp Technologies has been established to provide technical
services to all of Timbercorp
'
s agribusiness projects.

Timbercorp Technologies is currently developing consistent
management systems and protocols across Timbercorp
'
s operating
businesses in the areas of occupational health and safety, quality
assurance, management information systems and technical services.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Timbercorp loans to growers grew from \$172.6 million to \$182.8
million during the period. Interest income contributed \$8.1 million
to net profit after tax, compared with \$5.6 million in 1998/99.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

As Australia
'
s largest listed plantation forestry company, Timbercorp
is well placed to supply the expanding plantation wood-fibre market
and is presently conducting field trials of its patented whole tree
harvesting and in-field chipping process.

Directors expect 2000/01 to be a year of continued growth for
Timbercorp Limited, with continued strong demand for the company
'
s
eucalypt projects.

The horticultural projects in olives and almonds will provide new
opportunities and alternatives for growers and ultimately increase
shareholder value.

The company will continue to evaluate other agribusiness
opportunities to satisfy investor demand and provide economic benefit
to rural Australia.

TYNDALL PROPERTY TRUST
Sydney
Tyndall, the Responsible Entity for the Meridian Investment Trust,
has increased its forecast distribution for the year to June 2001
from 7.0 cents per unit to at least 7.3 cents per unit and a possible
7.5 cents if the merger with the Tyndall Property Trust is completed.

It also announced that it was revising the proposed terms of the
merger with the Tyndall Property Trust (TPT) by increasing the cash
component of the consideration from \$0.16 to \$0.19 per TPT unit.

INCREASED MERIDIAN DISTRIBUTIONS

Mr Michael Good, Tyndall
'
s Chief Executive - Asset Management, said;


"
Since our previous forecast, we have announced the proposed
investment in the MCS Retail Trust which is positive for earnings,
sold the under-performing Lennons Hotel and have completed a
comprehensive review of Meridian
'
s leases in the context of the GST
legislation. The result of this review has indicated that our earlier
GST estimates were conservative and we now expect higher earnings for
Meridian unitholders.
"


The forecast of 7.3 cents does not reflect any impact that may come
from a proposed unit buyback in Meridian which is expected to enhance
distribution, nor does it reflect any increase that may arise from
the proposed merger with Tyndall Property Trust. On completion of the
merger, based on the revised terms set out below, Meridian forecast
distributions will increase to 7.5 cents per unit for the year ending
30 June 2001.


"
At 7.3 cents per unit, distributions will have grown by 22% in two
years,
"
 Mr Good said. 
"
Notwithstanding the recent increase in unit
price, Meridian is still trading at a yield approaching 10%, all of
which is tax advantaged. This represents an equivalent fully taxable
yield of over 15% for a top marginal tax rate investor.
"


REVISED MERGER TERMS

Meridian intends to revise the terms it had previously proposed for
the merger with the Tyndall Property Trust by increasing the cash
component of the consideration from \$0.16 to \$0.19 per TPT unit. The
other components of the offer remain unchanged. The full terms of the
merger are therefore \$0.19 cash plus 0.3 Meridian Convertible Notes
per TPT unit. In addition, TPT unitholders will be entitled to a
distribution of 1.65 cents per unit, representing an estimate of
income from TPT between 15 November 1999 and the effective date of
the merger. The terms of the Convertible Notes remain unchanged.

Based on an issue price of \$0.90 per Convertible Note, the value of
the offer, excluding the distribution, is \$0.46 per TPT unit.
Registered holders (as at the close of business on 31 March 2000)
with holdings of less than 2,000 units or with registered addresses
outside Australia and New Zealand will receive \$0.46 per unit in
cash.

Commenting on the increase, Mr Good said:


"
The offer stands at a slight premium to where we believe the wind-up
value of TPT is and is also a significant premium over the TPT unit
price prior to the merger announcement. We believe this is an
attractive offer for TPT unitholders and it will not be revised
further.
"
 The revised offer was made after a reassessment of the
wind-up value of TPT.


"
TPT unitholders should be aware that whilst the Net Tangible Assets
of TPT at 15 November 1999 was \$0.498, this is prepared on a 
"
going
concern
"
 basis and accordingly overstates what unitholders would
receive should TPT be wound up. Specifically stamp duty and
acquisition costs from recent acquisitions are carried on the balance
sheet and would not be recovered. In addition, no provision is made
for asset sale costs, funding break costs or the costs associated
with running down the trust.
"


The merger presents an opportunity for a win for both Trusts as the
structure enables Meridian to gain access to a portfolio of assets in
a cost efficient way, whilst delivering an attractive outcome for TPT
unitholders,
"
 Mr Good said.

Due to the changes in the terms of the proposal, it is expected that
unitholder meetings in Meridian and TPT will now occur in May 2000.

TROY RESOURCES NL
Melbourne
On 28 November 2000, Troy Resources NL (
"
Troy
"
) announced that it had
applied to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for a
modification to allow Troy to waive a defeating condition to the
takeover bid.

On 5 December 2000 ASIC informed Troy that it had rejected its
application. Troy has appealed to the Panel against the decision of
ASIC to refuse its application. The Panel has announced today that it
has decided to conduct proceedings in relation to Troy
'
s appeal.

Also today, the Supreme Court of Western Australia handed down its
reasons for decision on the preliminary issues referred to it. The
Supreme Court has confirmed that 
"
options
"
 are equity securities. The
ruling allows Troy Resources and others to argue that Taipan was
required to pass a special resolution approving implementation of the
scheme because a company associated with Stephen Miller holds options
in St Barbara. The ruling by the Supreme Court also allows Troy
Resources and others to argue that the scheme required passage by a
special resolution if Troy Resources can show that St Barbara and
Strata Mining NL were acting in concert. These matters will be dealt
with at the hearing of the matter, anticipated to take place in
January 2001.

UNION CAPITAL LIMITED

TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS UPDATE:

* IDENTIKEY:

The Directors of Identikey have advised Union that they intend to
proceed with the planned IPO. However, given the current unsettled
market conditions the timing of the IPO will be reviewed by the Board
of Identikey on a monthly basis.

The first Board meeting of Identikey was held on 1st June 2000.
Union is impressed with the highly effective Board of Directors that
Identikey have appointed under the leadership of Chairman the
Honourable Jeff Kennett. Other directors appointed are Mr Mark
Kefford (CEO), Mr Peter David (COO), Mr Alan Beanland, Mr Adrian
McCullagh, Mr Hans-Rudolph Moser and Mr Rob Murdoch. Identikey feels
that the strengths of its board members will play a significant role
in the ongoing development of the company.

Identikey have recently taken positive steps to increase their
marketing efforts globally, which is being reflected in increasing
sales. Product demonstrations and participation at trade shows have
commenced in Asia in association with business partners, Byte Power
and Computer Associates. An effective sales force has been assembled
in Europe, under Mr Peiter Versteeg, who has been appointed as
European Sales Manager. In the US, sales personnel have been secured
and an office has been established under the management of Mr Dennis
Firenze. Sales in Australia have also improved significantly in the
past two months.

The Identikey web site (www.identikey.com) has been enhanced to
include Mandarin to the existing German and English versions. A Dutch
version is expected to be added in the next few months.

* RADIOCITY


"
RadioCity
"
 have advised Union that they have joined forces with
Microsoft Australia to promote low cost usage of the Internet for
audio and video netcasting. The partnership allows RadioCity to be a
featured content provider for the new Australian Media guide of the
Microsoft Windows Media Player 7, supplying streamed video. RadioCity
see the teaming with Microsoft as raising the community awareness of
the business advantages of the emerging industry presently referred
to loosely as 
"
Streaming Video, Internet Television and/or
Webcasting
"
.

The association with Microsoft demonstrates RadioCity
'
s emerging
position as an Australian Market leader in this fast growing
industry. This has been achieved from just one office in Brisbane.
RadioCity is targeting to establish additional offices in Sydney and
Melbourne, from where 80% of the Australian market is generated.

Union currently holds a 25% equity interest in RadioCity and to
enable the expansion to take place, has agreed to provide further
funding to RadioCity. The funding will take the form of two
convertible notes, which shall involve a program of staged monthly
drawdowns, that will be continued provided RadioCity meets certain
business targets agreed with Union by the due date each month.

The first Convertible Note will be for \$1.8million, which if
converted into equity will increase Union
'
s holding to 53.125% of the
total equity of RadioCity. A second Convertible Note of \$1.2 million
will be made available subject to RadioCity meeting certain other
business targets by the time the first Convertible Note is fully
drawn. If the second note is converted into equity it will increase
Union
'
s holding to 62.5% of the total equity of RadioCity.

* SHOPAHOLIC

Shopaholic and Union have mutually agreed not to continue the
investment opportunity previously announced, whereby Union would earn
a 32.5% equity interest in Shopaholic in return for an amount of 
\$A2.5 million which Union proposed to inject into Shopaholic. This
money is now available for other technology investments.

* MARKETING MANAGER

In recognition of the fundamental need that all technology
investments work in a highly competitive market and need to maximize
sales, Union has added to its technology advisory team Mr Stephen
Kress. Stephen is an American citizen who has considerable experience
in marketing technology products and companies in the U.S.A, Japan
and Germany. His global marketing experience will add to the strong

"
Union Technology Team
"
 also comprising Mr Nick Conway (Technology
Manager, who has strong technology skills) and Mr Peter Sauerberg
(CFO, with excellent corporate skills). This team has the role of
selecting, monitoring and nurturing all Union
'
s present and future
investments in technology. As a result, evaluation of other
investments continues.

VIVANET LIMITED

MEDIA RELEASE

Listed Internet infrastructure service provider VivaNET Limited ASX:
VNT today announced it has signed an agreement with fixed and mobile
Internet provider e-z.web. The contract is expected to be worth more
than \$2.5 million over the next two years. VivaNET will provide
Internet infrastructure services to e-z.web that will enable the
company to offer its own branded Internet services to customers.

E-z.web, a new breed of Australian Internet access providers, will
deliver e-z.web branded services and content to fixed and mobile
Internet users. E-z.web will initially be distributed through
Australia
'
s largest independently owned mobile phone retailer, Fone
Zone, with its network of 43 retail outlets across Eastern Australia.
E-z web
'
s customer base is expected to reach 63,000 subscribers over
the next two years.


"
This contract reinforces our position as the infrastructure provider
of choice for Internet suppliers. VivaNET has been consistently
growing by 40% on a quarterly compound basis,
"
 said VivaNET CEO,
Cardy Chung. 
"
We will provide e-z.web with comprehensive Internet
infrastructure solutions that will enable the company to offer
Internet access services in their own name and therefore retain
control of their customer base.
"
"
VivaNET specialises in ISP infrastructure we can brand as our own,
"

said Mr Darryl Hunt, General Manager, e-z.web. 
"
Other providers we
spoke to had their own retail service and were in direct competition
with us at the retail level. We like the fact that VivaNET is
dedicated to wholesale service.
"
"
The market has an overabundance of ISP offers. We
'
re different
because we provide our customers with what they want - easy,
face-to-face Internet connection. We distribute through retail
outlets. We don
'
t just supply a disk in the mail. Our subscribers can
come into a Forte Zone store, sit down, talk to a consultant and walk
out connected. With the trend towards wireless Internet service, we
are focusing on the mobile Internet user, as well as fixed line
connection,
"
 said Mr Hunt.

VivaNET has over 90 wholesale customers and an expanding network of
30 points of presence (POPs) Australia-wide. It recently announced
that Tomorrow Limited (currently trading as Mid-East Minerals Limited
ASX: MEM) has taken an option to invest \$50 million for a major
shareholding in the company.

WAIVCOM WORLDWIDE LIMITED
Melbourne
The Directors of WaivCom Worldwide Limited today announced that the
Group result for the year to June, 2000 was a loss of \$1,378,000.
Whilst the Group
'
s publishing activities traded profitably,
substantial development, expansion and consolidation costs were
expensed, resulting in the reported loss.

The year has witnessed considerable growth for WaivCom. Following the
acquisition of the MoneySaver direct mail business late in 1998/99,
considerable effort was dedicated to further expansion of the group
'
s
publishing activities. Following the assessment of numerous
opportunities, WaivCom acquired the Franchising and Facilities
Management magazine titles from Hassel, Hunt 
&
 Moore, and after a
lengthy period of negotiation, the acquisition of Niche Media was
completed in July, 2000.

The expanded publishing activities will broaden the Group
'
s exposure
to different market sectors, as well as enabling increased production
efficiency and economies of scale. Turnover from publishing increased
from \$1.1M in 1998/99 to \$7.6M in 1999/2000, and an increase of
similar magnitude is anticipated for next year.

Trading profits in both the 
"
Welcome To
"
 tourist publications, and
the MoneySaver direct mail products were satisfactory, and both are
well placed for further profit growth within the enlarged publishing
activities of the Group.

The result includes abnormal costs of \$741,000 arising from the
board
'
s decision to write off the substantial costs invested in
development of the group
'
s websites and e-commerce positioning. The
development of this functionality has become commonplace in the
publishing industry, and the Group has now created a platform that
will offer new products and distribution opportunities to both
existing clients, and a range of potential new clients. The board is
confident that this expenditure will deliver long term benefits to
shareholders in the future. However, it has adopted a conservative
accounting policy, and elected to expense the development costs.

Following completion of the Niche acquisition in July, the management
structure has been rationalised, and the board has been restructured.
The Group is confident that this new team will build on the expansion
and consolidation achieved during the past year, and deliver
significantly improved results over the next twelve months.

WESTPAC BANKING CORPORATION
Sydney
Westpac today announced that it has selected IBM Global Services
Australia (IBM GSA) as the preferred supplier to manage its core
banking technology operations in Australia, New Zealand and Pacific
Rim, with Telstra providing telecommunications services. Westpac will
now finalise negotiations with IBM GSA and Telstra, with the aim of
completion by the end of November.

The ten year contract with IBM GSA will see the outsourcing of
mainframe and mid-range computing and desktop services, while IT
systems development, strategy and architecture will remain in-house.
The five year agreement with Telstra will cover IT networks and
telecommunications services. The total value of both the IT and
telecommunication components is approximately \$4.3 billion.

Westpac
'
s Managing Director, Dr David Morgan said: 
"
The outsourcing
of the IT infrastructure and operations will result in significant
cost reductions by accessing the greater scale efficiencies of IBM
Global Services and Telstra while achieving day-to-day performance
improvement, including adopting standard platforms, processes and
infrastructure.
"


Westpac expects the agreement to deliver efficiency benefits of
between 15 and 20 per cent on the existing costs of these outsourced
functions. Some of these savings will be reinvested to accelerate the
roll-out of e-initiatives.

Under the agreement, all 1200 affected IT staff in Australia, New
Zealand and the Pacific Regional Bank will be offered positions with
IBM GSA / Telstra on terms that are equal to or better overall than
current terms and conditions.


"
We recognise the commitment and capability of our IT staff and have
placed great emphasis on the interests of staff through our
comprehensive outsourcing evaluation process,
"
 Dr Morgan said.


"
With the convergence of technology and communications it is no
longer possible for a single financial institution to keep up with
the latest developments. We can now draw on the global resources of
IBM and Telstra,
"
 said Mr Jeremy Gross, Westpac
'
s Group Executive,
Technology, Operations and e-Commerce.


"
The partnership between Westpac and IBM GSA/Telstra is also a key
step in our move towards an e-business focus by enabling Westpac to
leverage the infrastructure, scale and research and development
capabilities of global IT and telecommunication providers,
"
 said Mr
Gross.

IBM GSA is a joint venture between IBM Australia, Telstra and Lend
Lease, employing more than 10,000 highly skilled IT professionals
across Australia and the Asia Pacific. IBM GSA is the Australian
division of IBM Global Services - the services division of the IBM
Corporation.

Telstra is Australia
'
s leading provider of communications and
electronic information services, employing some 50,000 employees
globally. It has offices spread across Australia in all major capital
cities and regional centres, Asia Pacific, Europe and the USA.

The downward trend is the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate was 
re-established during the quarter with a fall to 1.5 per million hours
worked.  The total rate of Lost Time plus Medically Treated Injuries 
was also significantly improved at 13.0 per million hours worked.

In May we celebrated a Lost Time Injury free month across our global 
operations including all employees an contractors. 

The work initiated through the Elimination of Fatalities process,
which began in 1996, has been instrumental in the April recognition
of 12 months fatality free across the company and 25 months fatality
free in mining.

The work continues with the implementation of the Major Hazard 
Standards and the development of the Environment, Health 
&
 Safety 
Management System.

WMC DELIVERS EXCELLENT PRODUCTION AND EXPLORATION RESULTS

WMC
'
s second quarter production continues the trend set in the first
quarter to achieve new highs in copper, uranium and alumina;
position fertilizer production at more than 80 per cent capacity for
the second half, and meet targets in our other businesses. WMC also
made two significant exploration discoveries in Western Australia.

Olympic Dam exceeded the first quarters record copper production with
record quarterly production of 48,314 tonnes. Commissioning of the
new solvent extraction plant in June means that the business is
positioned to achieve its target of 200,000 tonnes of refined copper
this year.

Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC) alumina operations set new
production records at Kwinana, Wagerup and Pinjarra, demonstrating
the capacity of our alumina business to continue to expand to meet
growing demand. 

Nickel exceeded production targets for metal, matte and concentrate.
The solid production and cost performance will deliver an excellent
half-yearly profit. 

Gold production was up on the previous two quarters, and St Ives
received Government environmental approval for further potential
development on Lake Lefroy.

We had our most encouraging exploration results in many years. At
West Musgrave in Western Australia, we found exciting intersections
of nickel, copper, Platinum Group Metals and titanium. And at our St
Ives Gold Operation we began to define a new and significant area of
gold mineralisation that would support the further expansion of St
Ives.

This transformation of WMC is delivering continued excellent business
performance. This allowed us to progress to the half-way mark of the
five per cent share buy back and repay \$235 million of debt.
