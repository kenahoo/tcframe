The AI-Classifier directory contains the AI::Classifier framework.
I'm not yet sold on that name.  It might be possible to use
AI::Categorize, or even AI::Categorizer.

Note that there are two synonyms for classification - "classify"
vs. "categorize".  In this project I'm trying to stay away from
"classify", since that gives the word "class" a confusing double
meaning (OO class vs. semantic category).

I'm using the Class::Container module, soon to be on CPAN, to glue the
classes together into a framework.  It's been very helpful in the
HTML::Mason project, and has evolved there for several months of
intense development.
