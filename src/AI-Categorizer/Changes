Revision history for Perl extension AI::Categorizer.

0.04

 - Moved 'term_weighting' parameter from Document to KnowledgeSet,
   since the normalized version needs to know the maximum
   term-frequency.  Also changed its values to 'n', 'l', 'b', and 't',
   with 'x' a synonym for 't'.

 - Implemented full range of TF/IDF term weighting methods (see Salton
   & Buckley, "Term Weighting Approaches in Automatic Text Retrieval",
   in journal "Information Processing & Management", 1988 #5)
