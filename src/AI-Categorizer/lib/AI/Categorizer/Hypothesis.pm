=head1 NAME

AI::Categorizer::Hypothesis - Embodies a set of category assignments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use AI::Categorizer::Hypothesis;
 
 # Hypotheses are usually created by the Learner's categorize() method.
 # (assume here that $learner and $document have been created elsewhere)
 my $h = $learner->categorize($document);
 
 print "Assigned categories: ", join ', ', $h->categories, "\n";
 print "Best category: ", $h->best_category, "\n";
 print "Assigned scores: ", join ', ', $h->scores( $h->categories ), "\n";
 print "Chosen from: ", join ', ', $h->all_categories, "\n";
 print +($h->in_category('geometry') ? '' : 'not '), "assigned to geometry\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Hypothesis embodies a set of category assignments that a categorizer
makes about a single document.  Because one may be interested in
knowing different kinds of things about the assignments (for instance,
what categories were assigned, which category had the highest score,
whether a particular category was assigned), we provide a simple class
to help facilitate these scenarios.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new(%parameters)

Returns a new Hypothesis object.  Generally a user of
C<AI::Categorize> doesn't create a Hypothesis object directly - they
are returned by the Learner's C<categorize()> method.  However, if you
wish to create a Hypothesis directly (maybe passing it some fake data
for testing purposes) you may do so using the C<new()> method.

The following parameters are accepted when creating a new Hypothesis:

=over 4

=item all_categories

A required parameter which gives the set of all categories that could
possibly be assigned to.  The categories should be specified as a
reference to an array of category names (as strings).

=item scores

A hash reference indicating the assignment score for each category.
Any score higher than the C<threshold> will be considered to be
assigned.

=item threshold

A number controlling which categories should be assigned - any
category whose score is greater than or equal to C<threshold> will be
assigned, any category whose score is lower than C<threshold> will not
be assigned.

=item document_name

An optional string parameter indicating the name of the document about
which this hypothesis was made.

=back


=item categories()

Returns an ordered list of the categories the document was placed in,
with best matches first.  Categories are returned by their string names.

=item best_category()

Returns the name of the category with the highest score in this
hypothesis.

=item in_category($name)

Returns true or false depending on whether the document was placed in
the given category.

=item scores(@names)

Returns a list of result scores for the given categories.  Since the
interface is still changing, not very much can officially be said
about the scores, except that a good score is higher than a bad
score.  Individual Learners will have their own procedures for
determining scores, so you cannot compare one Learner's score with
another Learner's.  You often cannot compare scores from a single
Learner on two different categorization tasks either (for instance, if
the Learner always normalizes the top score to 1 or something).

=item all_categories()

Returns the list of category names specified with the
C<all_categories> constructor parameter.

=item document_name()

Returns the value of the C<document_name> parameter specified as a
constructor parameter, or C<undef> if none was specified.
